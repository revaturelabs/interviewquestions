<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- It’s simple, any console/desktop or web application that wants to leverage DI & other key features provided by Core Spring modules can use the Spring framework.
- Spring Boot framework was evolved on top of Spring framework to support microservices-based architecture on the cloud.
- Spring Boot framework is popularly used to develop Web/Enterprise Applications, RESTful API & Microservices.

2.Why do we need a `Service layer`? Can’t we call the `Repository layer` directly inside the `Controller layer`?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- There is no restriction from compiler, and we can call the Repository layer from the Controller layer directly.
- The layering helps to segregate the Spring application responsibilities and enables loose coupling between the objects.
- Service layer in the application facilitates communication between the Controller and the Persistence/Repository/DAO layer.
- Service layer usually holds business logic e.g.It may include validation logic.
- One Service layer may depend on multiple Repository layers to serve a specific business purpose.
- The method names in Service layer are usually named as per the business purpose they serve whereas method names in Repository are named as standard CRUD operations supported by that Repository.
- Hence, we need Service layer between DAO and Controller layer.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Since property file(s) are readable by anyone who has access to the codebase it is highly recommended not to keep the DB and other critical credentials inside property file(s).
- They are usually stored inside cloud environment variables or passed through command line arguments while executing the application.
```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments='
-Dspring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb 
-Dspring.datasource.username=admin 
-Dspring.datasource.password=gd123'

4.As a developer you need to check your production application status daily, how does Spring Boot could help here?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- One of the routine tasks for a developer is to check the status of the already launched production application periodically.
- To simplify this task, Spring Boot provides a sub-project named Spring Boot Actuator.
- Spring Actuator exposes operational information about the executing application, including, metrics, info, dump, env, etc.
- The information is accessed usually via HTTP endpoints, a few of which are listed below:
    - `/health` summarizes the health status of our application.
    - `/beans` returns all available beans in our BeanFactory.
    - `/envy returns the current environment properties.
- To enable Spring Boot Actuator, we just need to add the spring-boot-actuator dependency to our maven package manager.

```XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
- To access the actuator endpoints using HTTP, we need to both enable and expose them.
- Only the /health and /info endpoints are exposed by default.
- We need to add the following configuration to expose all endpoints: 
`management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*`

5.What is Spring profile and why do we use it?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Spring Profiles provide a way to segregate parts of your application configuration and make it only available in certain environments.
- Any `@Component`, `@Configuration` or `@ConfigurationProperties` can be marked with `@Profile` to limit when it is loaded.
```java
@Configuration
@Profile("prod")
public class ProductionConfiguration {
 // ...
}

@Configuration
@Profile("test")
public class TestConfiguration {
 // ...
}
```
- In the normal Spring way, you can use a `spring.profiles.active` environment property to specify which profiles are active.
- You can specify the property in any of the usual ways, for example, you could include it in your application.properties:
`spring.profiles.active=test`
or specify on the command line using the switch `--spring.profiles.active=prod`.
</blockquote>

6.How can you define multiple profiles in the Spring Boot application? How to add an active profile?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- The application development process undergoes different stages; the typical ones are development, testing, and production.
- Spring Boot profiles help group parts of the application configuration and make it available only in certain environments.
- A profile is a set of configuration settings.
- Spring Boot allows to definition profile of -specific property files in the form of `application-{profile}.properties`.
- We can define both profile-specific and default application.properties file in the application.(For example, if your application activates a profile named prod and uses YAML files, then both application.yml and application-prod.yml will be considered).
- The local/default profile (`application.properties`) is usually called `default`; all the beans that do not have a profile set belong to the `default` profile.
- Spring automatically loads the properties in an application.properties file for all profiles and the ones in profile-specific property files only for the specified profile.
- The keys in the profile-specific property override the ones in the default property file.
- There are plenty of ways of defining active profiles in Spring Boot, including command line arguments, Maven settings, JVM system parameters, environment variables, spring.profiles.active property, and SpringApplication methods.
- We commonly set active profiles using the `spring the .profiles.active` property or command line argument.
- For Example, we have three profiles (`local/default`, `dev`, `prod`) and two profile-specific property files as below:
```
pom.xml
src
├── main
│   ├── java
│   │   └── com
│   │       └── revature
│   │           └── Application.java
│   └── resources
│       ├── application-dev.properties
│       ├── application-prod.properties
│       └── application.properties
└── test
    └── java
```

7.What happens when two profiles are set for property `spring.profiles.active` in the Spring application?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- If several profiles are specified, a last-wins strategy applies.
- For example, if profiles prod,live are specified by the spring.profiles.active property (i.e.`spring.profiles.active=prod,live`), values in `application-prod.properties` can be overridden by those in `application-live.properties`.

8.Which `pom.xml` file inside the Spring Boot framework defines versions of all pre-configured dependencies?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Spring Boot framework has utilized the concept of parent and child pom file inheritance and defined all the dependencies specific to its release version under `spring-boot-dependencies` module.
- For example, refer to this link: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-dependencies/2.7.3/spring-boot-dependencies-2.7.3.pom

9.What is Bean Validation API? How can we use it in Spring?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- To restrict the input provided by the user in Spring MVC applications, the Spring >=4 supports and uses `Bean Validation API`.
- The Bean Validation API is a Java specification which is used to apply constraints to the fields of a class via annotations.
- Using Bean Validation API we can validate a length, number, regular expression, etc.as well, and build custom validations.
- `Hibernate Validator` is the most famous/used implementation of the Bean Validation API specification.
- There are 3 types of variables that can be validated using Bean Validation API:
  - The request body,
  - Variables within the path (e.g., id in /api/{id}) and,
  - Query parameters.
- Spring Boot comes with the validation starter, which needs to be included in `pom.xml` file and the intern added the `hibernate-validator` dependency as below:

```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
  </dependency>
```

10.Explain a few `hibernate-validator` Spring bean validation annotations?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Few common validation annotations are listed below:
  - `@NotNull`: Field must not be null.
  - `@NotEmpty`: List field must not be empty.
  - `@NotBlank`: String field must not be the empty String (i.e., it must have at least one Character).
  - `@Min` and `@Max`: Numerical field is only valid when its value is above or below a certain value.
  - `@Pattern`: String field is only valid when it matches a certain regular expression.
  - `@Email`: String field must be a valid email address.

11.What does the `@Valid` annotation indicate in Spring?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- The `@Valid` annotation can be added to variables in a `RestController` mapping method to validate them.
- In the below code our POST request takes in a request body, and we're mapping that request body to a class InputForm.
- The `@Valid` annotation will tell Spring to go and validate the data passed into the controller i.e., age is between 18 and 60 inclusive because of those Bean Validation API annotations (min and max).
```java
@RestController
public class ValidateFormController {
  @PostMapping("/validateInput")
  ResponseEntity<String> validateBody(@Valid @RequestBody InputForm inputForm) {
    return ResponseEntity.ok("valid");
  }
  // ...
}

public class InputForm {
  @Min(18)
  @Max(60)
  private int age;
  // ...
}
```

12.What is the use of `@ControllerAdvice` in the Spring application?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- `@ControllerAdvice` is a specialization of the `@Component` annotation which allows handling exceptions across the whole application in one global handling component.
- It intercepts exceptions thrown by methods annotated with `@RequestMapping` and similar.
- All you need to have is a class annotated with @ControllerAdvice.
- If any exception is raised in the defined controller [you can define to which packages this controller advice should listen for exception in base packages] then it is handled by ControllerAdvice.
```java
@ControllerAdvice(basePackages = "{com.revature.controller}")
public class RestApiExceptionHandlerAdvice {
    /** Handle all business exceptions here */  
}
```
</blockquote>

13.What is the use of `@ExceptionHandler` in the Spring application?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- The `@ExceptionHandler` is an annotation used to handle a specific exception in the controller and send a custom response to the client.
- We need to have a method annotated with @ExceptionHandler which takes Exception Class (any exception that you want to handle) as an argument, if any of these exceptions are raised in the controller, then this handler method will handle it.
- If we have two handler methods in the same controller say for example one handler for Exception and another handler for RuntimeException, then the handler method which is closer to the Exception Class hierarchy is triggered.
- For example, if NullPointerException is thrown then IOException handler method is triggered, which is the closest to the Exception class.
```java
@ControllerAdvice(basePackages = "{com.revature.controller}")
public class RestApiExceptionHandlerAdvice {
    @ExceptionHandler(value = BadRequestException.class)
    public ErrorMessage handleBadRequest(BadRequestException exception) {
        //code...
        return errMsg;
    }
    @ExceptionHandler(value = GatewayTimeoutException.class)
    public ErrorMessage handleGatewayTimeout(GatewayTimeoutException exception) {
        //code...
        return errMsg;
    } 
}

14.Have you used the HAL browser in Spring? How to use it?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- HAL stands for Hypertext Application Language.
- HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API.
- Adopting HAL make API explorable, and its documentation easily discoverable from within the API itself.
- In short, it makes API easier to work with and therefore more attractive to client developers.
- The HAL browser provides an in-browser GUI to traverse your Spring RESTful API.
- Below is the single dependency needed to integrate the HAL browser into our REST API.

```xml
  <dependency>
	  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
	  <artifactId>spring-data-rest-hal-explorer</artifactId>
  </dependency>
```
- If we have the above dependency, Spring will auto-configure the HAL browser, and make it available via the default endpoint.
- All we need to do now is press run and switch to the browser.The HAL browser will then be available on http://localhost:8080/

15.What is the use of the `ResponseEntity` class in Spring?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- `ResponseEntity` represents an HTTP response, including headers, body, and status.
- While `@ResponseBody` puts the return value into the body of the response, ResponseEntity also allows us to add headers and HTTP Status codes.
- It can be used in both `@RestController` and `@Controller`.
```java
 @RequestMapping("/handle")
 public ResponseEntity<String> handle() {
   URI location = ...;
   HttpHeaders responseHeaders = new HttpHeaders();
   responseHeaders.setLocation(location);
   responseHeaders.set("MyResponseHeader", "MyValue");
   return new ResponseEntity<String>("Hello World", responseHeaders, HttpStatus.CREATED);
 }
