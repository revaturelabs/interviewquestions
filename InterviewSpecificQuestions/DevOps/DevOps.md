5.What are the common steps in DevOps?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- The steps or phases for DevOps refers to the creation, testing, and deployment of an application.
    - Source code Control: Producing (writing) code and pushing to a repository
    - Building and Testing Automation: Test basic functionality of code (Generally unit testing) and create a new, working build
    - Deploying to Staging: Deployment of working build to a temporary environment
    - Acceptance Testing: Undergo other more complex tests (systems, integration) within temporary environment
    - Deployment of Build: Migrate working build to Production environment accessible by end users

6.What do you understand by Continuous Delivery?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- Development principle which focuses on the automation of the DevOps pipeline to the extent that human intervention is not required.
- Generally, source code control, building and testing, and deployment to staging are automated.
- While acceptance testing and if necessary, deployment to production environment may be handled by a Human or requires manual approval.

7.What do you understand by Continuous Deployment?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- Continuous deployment automates releasing an application to production.
- There is no manual gate at the stage of the pipeline before production (like Continuous Delivery).
- Any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production.

12.What are two types of Jenkins Pipeline syntax?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- A Jenkinsfile can be written using two types of syntax - Declarative and Scripted.
- Declarative and Scripted Pipelines are constructed fundamentally differently.
- Declarative Pipeline is a more recent feature of Jenkins Pipeline which:
    - provides richer syntactical features over Scripted Pipeline syntax, and
    - is designed to make writing and reading Pipeline code easier.

13.What do you mean by environment variable in Jenkins?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- Jenkins Pipeline exposes environment variables via the global variable `env`, which is available from anywhere within a `Jenkinsfile`.
- Few variables listed below-
  - `BUILD_NUMBER`: The current build number, such as "153".
  - `JOB_NAME`: Name of the project of this build, such as "foo" or "foo/bar".
  - `WORKSPACE`: The absolute path of the workspace.

14.What is the purpose of SonarLint?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- SonarLint is a free, open-source linting tool.
- A linting tool/linter is a software tool which, when integrated with an IDE, can provide increased code quality feedback to the developer.
- SonarLint is an IDE extension that helps detect and fix quality issues as we write code.
- For Eclipse, you can get it directly from the Eclipse Marketplace, and it will then detect new bugs and quality issues as we code (in Java, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Python).
