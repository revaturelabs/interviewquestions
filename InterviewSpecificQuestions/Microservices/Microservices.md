2.What do you understand by Monolithic Architectural style?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- `Monolithic Architectural Style` is traditional software development style.
- It is built as a unified one code base unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications.
- In Monolithic style code is tightly coupled and servers all of the business concerns together. 
- To make a change to Monolithic of application requires update to entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface.
- This leads to changes/updates restrictive and time-consuming.

3.Why we should avoid Monolithic Style? 

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
  - There are many drawbacks of using Monolithic Style as listed below-
  - **Slower development speed**  due to large, complex monolithic application.
  - We **canâ€™t scale individual components**.
  - As application evolves & become complex, **making changes are often expensive and time-consuming**.
  - Small change in monolithic application requires the **redeployment of the entire project**.
  - **Difficult to change framework/language** hence barrier to technology adoption.
  - Developer are **constrained by the technologies already used** in the monolith.
  - Due to one **smallest error the entire applications can be down and unavailable**.

  - Yes there are too few advantages of Monolithic applications as listed below-
  - One code base, it is **easier to develop**.
  - Single build unit makes **deployment easier**.
  - **Better performance** due to centralized code base.
  - **Simplified end-to-end testing** due to single, centralized unit.
  - **Easy debugging** to locate application issues.
  - **Cost of hosting** is less compared to microservices style.

5.How do you go about designing microservices?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Microservices is an architecture style to build large scale applications that can be scaled up independently.
- In a microservice architecture design, we divide an application into suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.
- These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment process.
- There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.
- Each service runs a unique process and manages its database.
- A service can generate alerts, log data, support user interfaces (UIs), handle user identification or authentication, and perform various other tasks.

6.What if there are already complex, huge legacy applications operational for decades? Can we convert them into microservices?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Top companies in the world for example Amazon, Netflix, Uber, etc., have adopted the microservices architecture(`MSA`) style for developing their applications.
- Over time, these enterprises dismantled their monolithic applications and refactored them into microservice-based architectures.
- Usually, the legacy applications which involved huge capital and way complex at core takes time to slowly migrate to MSA.
- Companies are trying to migrate first the UI or client facing layer to MSA followed by slowly moving towards the core complex layers.
- This has given them scaling advantages, greater business agility, and increased profits.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Netflix Eureka is used as Service Discovery Server.
- Each client microservice need to first register with Eureka server.
- Post registration Eureka server provides metadata such as host, post, and health indicators which allows other microservices to discover it.
- The discovery server expects a regular heartbeat message from each microservice instance.
- If any microservice instance consistently fail to send a heartbeat, then the discovery server will remove the instance from its registry.
- This way Eureka server maintains very stable ecosystem of microservices collaborating with each other.

19.How to fetch service URL from `Service Discovery` server using `DiscoveryClient`?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- To fetch service URL from Service Discovery server we will inject `org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.DiscoveryClient` in our service/controller layer.
- `DiscoveryClient` represents operations commonly available to Discovery service such as Netflix Eureka or Consul.
- One service might be registered with same name on multiple ports hence we first need to get list of its all instances using `getInstances(String)` method of `DiscoveryClient`.
- We can then choose any of the retrieved instances and invoke get the service's base URL using getUri() method as shown below-
  
```java
	StringBuilder responseText = new StringBuilder();
	List<ServiceInstance> instances = discoveryClient.getInstances("employee-producer");
		for (int i = 0; i < instances.size(); i++) {
			System.out.println("[" + i + "]  -->  " + instances.get(i).getUri());
			responseText.append("\n[" + i + "]  -->  " + instances.get(i).getUri());
		}
		System.out.println("Using the first producer service got from DiscoveryClient:" + instances.get(0).getUri());
		responseText.append("\n\n\nUsing the first service:\n" + instances.get(0).getUri());
		ServiceInstance serviceInstance = instances.get(0);
		String baseUrl = serviceInstance.getUri().toString();
		baseUrl = baseUrl + "/employee";

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Yes, there is client and server-side load balancing.
- In server-side load balancing, the clients call an intermediate reverse proxy server, which then decides which instance of the actual server or microservice) will get call.
- In client-side load balancing, the clients call an intermediate server (the API gateway - e.g., Zuul, configured with a load-balancer - e.g., Ribbon and a discovery server - e.g.Eureka), which then decides which instance of the microservice to call.

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Ensure the Service Discovery Eureka server is up and running, assuming itâ€™s running locally on port 8761 [http://localhost:8761/].
- Ensure you have multiple instances of one service already registered on Eureka with unique ids as `serviceName:portNo` e.g., `my-service:8080`, `my-service:7070` & `my-service:9090`.
- For using Netflix Ribbon, we need to add below one additional dependency inside pom.xml file along with usual dependencies-

```xml
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
		<version>Camden.SR6</version>
		<type>pom</type>

	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-ribbon</artifactId>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
```
- To use client-side load balancer we will inject `org.springframework.cloud.client.loadbalancer.LoadBalancerClient` in our service/controller layer.
- With the help of LoadBalancerClient object we will fetch service url as below-
```java
		StringBuilder responseText = new StringBuilder();
		ServiceInstance serviceInstance = loadBalancer.choose("my-service");
		System.out.println("Using the only producer service got from LoadBalancerClient:" + serviceInstance.getUri());
		responseText.append("Using the only producer service got from LoadBalancerClient:\n" + serviceInstance.getUri());
		String baseUrl = serviceInstance.getUri().toString();
		baseUrl = baseUrl + "/employee";
```
- Once the service URL is retrieved, we will invoke service normally (e.g., using RestTemplate)

- We need to create Zuul filters (i.e., PreFilter, PostFilter, RouteFilter, ErrorFilter)  by extending `com.netflix.zuul.ZuulFilter` .
- Set zuul routes properties inside application.properties file-

```
#All requests http://localhost:8079/product-producer/ will be diverted to this resource http://localhost:10000/info
zuul.routes.product-producer.url=http://localhost:10000/info
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
server.port=8079
```
- Annotate the Spring Boot application main class with @EnableZuulProxy annotation-
```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.zuul.EnableZuulProxy;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import com.revature.filter.ErrorFilter;
import com.revature.filter.PostFilter;
import com.revature.filter.PreFilter;
import com.revature.filter.RouteFilter;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@EnableZuulProxy
public class EmployeeZuulGatwayApplication {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(EmployeeZuulGatwayApplication.class, args);
	}
	@Bean
	public PreFilter preFilter() {
		return new PreFilter();
	}
	@Bean
	public PostFilter postFilter() {
		return new PostFilter();
	}
	@Bean
	public ErrorFilter errorFilter() {
		return new ErrorFilter();
	}
	@Bean
	public RouteFilter routeFilter() {
		return new RouteFilter();
	}
}
```
- Now all the requests to http://localhost:8079/product-producer/ will be diverted to this resource http://localhost:10000/info due to Zuul routing.

31.What are Zuul Filter & its types?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Netflix Zuul mainly comprises of four types of filters.
- Filter enable us to intercept the traffic in different timeline of the request processing.
- We can add any number of filters for a particular url pattern.
  - `Pre filters` â€“ Invoked before the request is routed.
  - `Post filters` â€“ Invoked after the request has been routed.
  - `Route filters` â€“ Used to route the request.
  - `Error filters` â€“ Invoked when an error occurs while handling the request.

32. What is meaning of Blue/Green Deployments?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- A blue/green deployment is an application deployment strategy.
- First, we create two separate, but identical environments.
- One environment (blue) is running the current application version and one environment (green) is running the new application version.
- Using a blue/green deployment strategy increases application availability and reduces deployment risk by simplifying the rollback process if a deployment fails.
- Once testing has been completed on the green environment, live application traffic is directed to the green environment and the blue environment is deprecated.
