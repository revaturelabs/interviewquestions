- The `Test Pyramid Model` is a way of thinking about the different types of tests that should be used when developing software. 
- The idea is that there should be more low-level unit tests than higher-level integration tests. 
- This is because unit tests can be run more quickly and cheaply, and they can be used to target specific parts of the code.
- By having more unit tests, you can find and fix bugs before they make their way into the integration tests and eventually into production.

- Incident reports are managed through a life cycle from discovery to resolution.
- The Incident report life cycle is often shown as a state transition diagram. 
- While your defect-tracking system may use a different life cycle, let's take this one as an example to illustrate how an incident report life cycle might work.
- All incident reports move through a series of clearly identified states after being reported. 
- Some of these state transitions occur 
  - when a member of the project team completes some assigned tasks related to closing an incident report. 
  - when the project team decides not to repair a defect during this project, leading to the deferral of the incident report. 
  - when an incident report is poorly written or describes behaviour which is correct, leading to the rejection of that report.

- With the right mindset, developers can test their own code.
- The separation of this responsibility to a tester is typically done to help focus effort and provide additional benefits, such as an independent view by trained and professional testing resources.

54. Name a few parameters monitored during Performance Testing.

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

A few parameters which are monitored during Performance Testing are listed below:

- **Processor Usage** – an amount of time the processor spends executing non-idle threads.
- **Memory use** – the amount of physical memory available to processes on a computer.
- **Disk time** – the amount of time the disk is busy executing a read or write request.
- **Bandwidth** – shows the bits per second used by a network interface.
- **Response time** – the time from when a user enters a request until the first character of the response is received.
- **Throughput** – rate a computer or network receives requests per second
- **Amount of connection pooling** – the number of user requests that are met by pooled connections. The more requests met by connections in the pool, the better the performance will be.
- **Maximum active sessions** – the maximum number of sessions that can be active at once.
- **Database locks** – locking of tables and databases needs to be monitored and carefully tuned.
- **Thread counts** – An application’s health can be measured by the no. of threads that are running and currently active.
- **Garbage collection** – It has to do with returning unused memory back to the system. Garbage collection needs to be monitored for efficiency.

<blockquote>

- High-level functions and scope of a system can be depicted using a User Case diagram. 
- The use cases and actors in use-case diagrams describe what the system does and how the actors use it, but not how the system operates internally.

<blockquote>

- Happy Path in Use Case Analysis refers to the "path" that the user takes to achieve the desired result without encountering any error.  
- Happy path test is a well-defined test case using known input, which executes without exception and produces an expected output.

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

- An exception path is an unintended path through the system usually because of missing information or system availability issues.  
- Exception paths represent an undesirable path to the user.  
- However, even though the exception path has occurred the system should still react in a way that recovers the flow and provides some useful information to the user.

60. What is `Data-Driven Testing (DDT)`?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

- Data-Driven Testing (DDT) is where data that is external to our functional tests is loaded and used to extend our automated test cases. 
- Data-Driven Testing is taking a test, parameterizing it and then running that test with varying data.
- We can take the same test case and run it with as many different inputs as we like, thus getting better coverage from a single test.
- This could be an Excel document, an XML file, a MySQL database, etc.
- Data-driven testing allows the ability to build both positive and negative test cases into a single test.
