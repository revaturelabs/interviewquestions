<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

API testing can be done on the below aspects:
- `Functional Testing`: Checks API's functionality, takes payload in the form of JSON or XML and provides the response code and response body.
- `Load Testing`:  Checks the performance under the specific load and determines how much traffic the API can handle before being overloaded.
- `Security Testing`: Checks vulnerabilities like authentication and sensitive data is encrypted over HTTP and includes penetration testing validating authentication.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

There are many benefits to automating API testing, including:
- **Improved accuracy**: Automated tests improves precision over manual testing.
- **Reduced cost**: Comparatively less expensive to run than manual tests.
- **Increased coverage**: Can cover a larger area of functionality than manual tests.
- **Faster feedback**: Quicker results than manual tests.
- **Easier maintenance**: Easier to maintain and update than manual tests.
- **Reduced human error**: Produce fewer errors than manual tests run by DevOps.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

- `Newman` is a command-line Collection Runner for Postman.
- We can run and test a Postman Collection directly from the command line.
- It's built with extensibility in mind and easily integrates with CI servers and build systems.
- Newman resides in the npm registry and on GitHub.

8.How Postman collections are passed to Newman for API testing?
   
![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

- Newman expects or consumes the JSON version of the collection as input.
- It can be obtained by simply exporting the collection in JSON collection format from the postman or the URL of the Postman collection which is nothing but the same JSON that’s obtained by the collection export.

```
newman run {{collectionJsonPath}}
      OR
newman run {{collectionUrl}}
```

9.Is it possible to generate HTML report using Newman?
   
![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

- There are few custom node modules available for generating Newman test execution reports.
- First, we need to install the `newman-HTML-reporter` module.

```
npm install -g newman-reporter-html
```
- Once the node module is installed, it can be used along with the Newman run command as follows:

```
newman run Postman_Newman_Collection.json -e enVariable.json -r html
```
- The '-r' flag, indicates the newman-reporter-html module to be used with the Newman collection run.

- SoapUI can be used for complete RESTful API and SOAP Web Service testing.
- We can do Functional Testing, Performance Testing, Interoperability Testing & Regression Testing etc using SoapUI.
- Using SoapUI we can-
  - simulate Web Services.
  - record tests and use them Later.
  - create code stubs from the WSDL.
  - create REST specifications (WADL)from recorded communication.
  - Just right-click a functional test and run it as a load test.

|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| SoapUI is NOT used for User Interface Testing.It is only used for WebAPI or WebService Testing | Selenium is used for User Interface Testing.|
| Capability to test the data sent and received between the web browser and a web server.Can test protocols/technologies such as REST, and SOAP.| Selenium cannot test protocols, but it can test the UI behaviour.|
| SoapUI is able to perform functional, load and Security Testing of the above-mentioned technologies.| Selenium can perform only Functional Testing.Performance Testing to some extent because we can track execution time with regards to the performance but cannot test multi-user and multi-tenancy.Selenium certainly cannot be used for security testing.|
|SoapUI is PROTOCOL Dependent and NOT browser dependent.| Selenium depends on the browser’s capabilities.|
