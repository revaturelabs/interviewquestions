6.Why do you need Selenium Automation Testing?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Let's consider a scenario: Checking whether the web app’s signup page (www.example.com/signup) validates input strings and registers a user successfully.

Assume that the signup page has these input fields—username, email address, and password.

As a manual tester, we need to follow these steps:

1.Enter the URL in the address bar (www.example.com/signup)
2.Enter an invalid string in each input field (email, username, and password)
3.Check whether the input strings were validated against corresponding regexes and any pre-existing values in the database
4.Enter _valid_ strings in each input field; click Sign Up
5.Check whether _Welcome, {username}_ page showed up
6.Check whether the system database created a new userID for _{username}_
7.Mark the test _passed_ if it did, _failed_ if the signup feature broke anywhere during the test.

Depending on the number of manual testers (and the thoroughness of test cases), it may take anywhere between hours to weeks to be sure that the web app is fully functional.

Modern developers and product teams don’t have that kind of time to allow for testing, but they can’t set aside exhaustive testing in a hurry to release either.

Therefore, we go for automation testing with Selenium.

- Consider the situation when we need to run a test scenario multiple time.
- Assume we need to ensure that the login feature is functional for all types of subscribers.
- This necessitates repeating the login functionality scenario.
- Copying and pasting the identical instructions to just re-run the code does not appear to be a good approach.

Scenario Outline is used when the same scenario needs to be executed for multiple sets of data, however, the test steps remain the same.Also, a Scenario outline is a way of parameterization of scenarios.

```
Scenario Outline: A user wants to update the status of any potentially completed todos
		Given the user has <complete> completed todos and <incomplete> incomplete todos in their list of todos
		When the user hits the CHECK TODOS button
		Then <complete> of the todos will be marked as complete on the page
		And there should be a total of <total> todos listed on the page
		
		Examples:
			| complete | incomplete | total   |
			| 3        | 6          | 9       |
			| 10       | 1          | 11      |

	- Given: specifies a precondition to an event that will or should or occur during a scenario.
	- When: specifies the occurrence of the event itself.
	- Then: specifies the expected outcome of the event that has occurred.
- Background: used when all the scenarios within a feature share at least one precondition.The preconditions defined using the background keyword apply to all scenarios within a feature.
- Scenario Outline: used to create a data-driven driven scenario that is run several times around different sets of data.
- Examples: used to define data sets for scenario outlines.
- And/But: used to replace given, when, or then.If, for instance, there are multiple preconditions for a scenario, a developer may choose to use and our but for every precondition following the first precondition.

For example:

```
Given first precondition
And second precondition
And third precondition
When event occurs
And another event occurs
Then expected outcome

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>


The general workflow for implementing BDD using Cucumber is as follows:

1.A developer must first write their feature files in Gherkin.A feature file defines several scenarios and steps to define a system's behaviour level.
2.After the developer has finished drafting the feature file, they should generate their glue code by running the feature file.We'll talk more about glue code in the future, but for now, you need only know that this glue code consists of potential test methods that are associated with a scenario's steps.We say "potential" test methods because the developer may or may not choose to implement those suggested test methods.
3.Once the developer has generated the glue code and written the tests, they should choose a test runner for running the glue code.

- While Gherkin is understandable for everyone on a development team, feature files are not compatible with the programming languages in which applications are written.
- If, for instance, a developer is writing an application in Java, the compiler can't make sense of Gherkin.
- Because of this incompatibility, Cucumber allows developers to "translate" Gherkin into source code into the appropriate source code based on the BDD keywords used within the feature file.
- The source code that Cucumber generates is called glue code.

Selenium will throw a `NoSuchElementException`.There is also a chance that we have a reference to an element that no longer exists.

In NoSuchElementException cases, we would like to wait for the element to appear.There are two ways of approaching this:

- Implicit waits are a global configuration on the WebDriver object and apply every time the DOM is queried.
- Explicit waits apply individually and adjust the waiting time explicitly and dynamically at regular intervals.

Imagine you are trying to automate a single-page application.There are multiple views that you need to interact with and many elements to query for.Navigating to pages and repeatedly querying the DOM can result in messy, unorganized code.A simple design pattern to organize your code around is called the Page Object Model.

<blockquote>


- Page Object Model, also known as POM, is a design pattern in Selenium that creates an object repository for storing all web elements.
- It is useful in reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance.
- In-Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file.

40.What is `Page Factory` in Selenium?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>


`Page Factory` is a class provided by Selenium WebDriver to support Page Object Design patterns.
In Page Factory, testers use `@FindBy` annotation.
The `initElements` method is used to initialize web elements.

`@FindBy:` An annotation used in Page Factory to locate and declare web elements using different locators.Below is an example of declaring an element using @FindBy

```java
@FindBy(id="elementId") WebElement element;
```

initElements(): initElements is a static method in Page Factory class.Using the initElements method, one can initialize all the web elements located by @FindBy annotation.

<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>


Selenium provides a wide range of functionalities and methods to handle alerts.

The following methods are useful to handle alerts in selenium:

1.void dismiss(): This method is used when the 'Cancel' button is clicked in the alert box.
```java
driver.switchTo().alert().dismiss();
```
2.void accept(): This method is used to click on the 'OK' button of the alert.
```java
driver.switchTo().alert().accept();
```
3.String getText(): This method is used to capture the alert message.
```java
driver.switchTo().alert().getText();
```
4.void sendKeys(String stringToSend): This method is used to send data to the alert box.
```java
driver.switchTo().alert().sendKeys("Text");
```

43.How I can select a value from the dropdown using Selenium?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

The following methods help us to select a desired option/value from the dropdown list.

- selectByVisibleText() method is used to select one of the options in a drop-down box or an option among multiple selection boxes.

```java
Select objSelect =new Select(driver.findElement(By.id("search-box")));
objSelect.selectByVisibleText("Automation");
```

- selectByIndex() method is similar to ‘selectByVisibleText’, but the difference here is that the user has to provide the index number for the option rather than the text

```java
Select objSelect = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id("Search-box")));
Select.selectByIndex(4);
```

- selectByValue() method asks for the value of the desired option rather than the option text or an index.

```java
Select objSelect = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id("Search-box")));
objSelect.selectByValue("Automation Testing");
```
