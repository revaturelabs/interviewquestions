<blockquote> 
    
- Git repository refers to a folder/location where all the Git files are stored.
- These files can either be stored on the local repository or the remote repository.
- The local repository is the folder inside your system where you will find one hidden folder named `.git`

4.What do you mean by initializing a repository in Git? How do we do it?

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Usually, when a new project is created, developers first initialize the local repository using `Git` on their system.
- Initializing a repository in Git means creating a directory that will start tracking the changes to your files or source code.
- To do this, we first create a simple empty directory for our application and execute the below command using Git-

```
git init
```

- After the above command, a hidden `.git` folder will appear in the directory.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Ideally, the contents of the  .git folder are modified by the `git` command, we are not supposed to tamper with any files manually.
- The .git folder contains all information that is necessary for the project and all information relating to commits, remote repository address, etc.
- It also contains a log that stores the commit history and helps to roll back to the desired version of the code.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- The staging area also called an index, is where commits are prepared.
- The index compares the files in the working tree to the files in the repo.
- When you make a change in the working tree, the index marks the file as modified before it is committed.

16. What are the benefits of the source code repository?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 


Using a source code repository has many potential benefits for an organization, including:

- **Concurrent Development:** Repositories usually allow multiple developers to make edits to different parts of the same program simultaneously.Developers can then merge their changes back into the main program.
- **Increased Transparency:** Most source code repositories require a developer to check out, edit, and then check back in the part of the program he or she was editing.The repository records which developer made changes and when, resulting in a log of updates made to the program over time.
- **Version Control:** When developers make enough changes to a program stored in a source code repository, they can designate the updated program as a new “version” of the software.A repository also stores previous versions of a program, a feature that allows companies to restore a previous version if, for example, an update introduces a harmful bug.
