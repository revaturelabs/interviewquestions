At any given time, a thread can be in one of these states:

- New: newly created thread that has not started executing
- Runnable: either running or ready for execution but waiting for its resource allocation
- Blocked: waiting to acquire a monitor lock to enter or re-enter a synchronized block/method
- Waiting: waiting for some other thread to perform an action without any time limit
- Timed_Waiting: waiting for some other thread to perform a specific action for a specified time period
- Terminated: has completed its execution

4.How can we differentiate `notify()` and `notifyAll()` methods ?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>


- `notify()`: It sends a notification and wakes up only a single thread instead of multiple threads that are waiting on the object’s monitor.

- `notifyAll()`: It sends notifications and wakes up all threads and allows them to compete for the object's monitor instead of a single thread.

5. Explain synchronization process? Why we use it?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource. In the Multithreading concept, multiple threads try to access the shared resources at a time to produce inconsistent results. The synchronization is necessary for reliable communication between threads.

6. Explain thread starvation?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

Thread starvation is basically a situation or condition where a thread won’t be able to have regular access to shared resources and therefore is unable to proceed or make progress. This is because other threads have high priority and occupy the resources for too long. This usually happens with low-priority threads that do not get CPU for its execution to carry on.

7. Can you start a thread twice?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

No, it's not at all possible to restart a thread once a thread gets started and completes its execution. Thread only runs once and if you try to run it for a second time, then it will throw a runtime exception i.e., `java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException`.
