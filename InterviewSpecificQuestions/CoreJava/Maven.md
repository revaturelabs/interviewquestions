![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- To configure the Maven in Java, you need to use Project Object Model, which is stored in a pom.xml-file.
- POM includes all the configuration setting related to Maven.Plugins can be configured and edit in the  `<plugins>` tag of a pom.xml file and developer can use any plugin without much detail of each plugin.
- When user start working on Maven Project, it provides default setting of configuration, so the user does not need to add every configuration in pom.xml.

- package : take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
- integration-test : process and deploy the package if necessary, into an environment where integration tests can be run.
- verify :  run any checks to verify whether the package is valid and meets quality criteria.
- install : install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.
- deploy : done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

There are three types of Maven repositories:

    - Local repository refers to the machine of the developer where all the project material is saved.The local repository contains all the dependency jars.
2.Remote Repository:
    - The remote repository refers to the repository present on a server usually in company intranet to download dependencies.
    - The advantage of remote repository is that it can have all publicly available dependencies as well as private dependencies used only in intranet by employees of the enterprise.
3.Central Repository:
    - Central repository refers to the Maven community that comes into action when there is a need for dependencies, and those dependencies cannot be found in the local repository.
    - Maven downloads the dependencies from here in the local repository whenever needed.
