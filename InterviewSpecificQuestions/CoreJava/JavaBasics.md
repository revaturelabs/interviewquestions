Access modifiers allow us to set the scope or accessibility, or visibility of a data member be it a field, constructor, class, or method. The four different types of access specifiers
- Public
- Protected
- Private
- Default

Private is more protective.When the methods or data members declared as private, then we can access them only within the class in which they are declared.

When we create a variable within a method, it cannot be accessed outside that method.The scope of that variable is a local scope.

**Example:** Here `age` is a variable declared inside the `printAge()` method.It can be accessed only inside the `printAge()`.So, we can say `age` variable has a local scope

```java
public class Test {

	public void printAge() {
		int age = 7;
		System.out.println(age);
	}
}

Variables can be defined as having one of three types of scope: 

- **Class level scope or Instance scope** (instance variables): Any variable declared within a class is accessible by all methods in that class.
- **Method level scope or Local scope** (local variables): Any variable declared within a method and arguments is only accessible inside that method.
- **Block scope** (loop variables): Any variable declared in a for loop condition is not accessible after the loop, unless you defined it beforehand.

- It’s a non-access modifier.
- It’s used to share the same variable or method of a given class.
- When we declare a variable or method as static that will not belong to any object, it belongs to the class.
- There is no need to create an object for the class to access the static variable or static method.
- We can use the class name to call them with respect to the access modifier.
- If we use the object name to call the static method or variable, the compiler will replace the name of the object with class.

15.What does the Final keyword mean for Variables, Methods, and Classes?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

final keyword is a non-access specifier that can be used with class, variable, and method to restrict changes or make it as constant.

- If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value.
- If we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses.
- And, if we declare a class as final, we restrict the other classes to inherit or extend it.

```

Final Variable  ---> To create constant variable
Final Method    ---> Prevents Method Overriding
Final Class     ---> Prevents Inheritance

<details>

<blockquote>
 
 `public static void main(String[] args)` -  main method is the e**ntry point of any java program**

- `public` is an access specifier of the main method.It must be `public` so that java runtime can execute this method.
- `static` is non-access modifier.When java runtime starts, there is no object of the class present.That’s why the main method must be static so that JVM can load the class into memory and call the main method.
- `void`is a return type, means main method not going to return anything.
- `main` is a method name  
- `String[] args` - Java main method accepts a single argument of type String array.This is also called as java command line arguments.

No, A static method cannot access non-static variables or methods because static methods can be accessed without instantiating the class, so if the class is not instantiated the variables are not initialized and thus cannot be accessed from a static method.
