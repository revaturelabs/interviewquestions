        List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(3, 4, 6, 12, 20);
        // Getting a stream consisting of the
        // elements that are divisible by 5
        // Using Stream filter(Predicate predicate)
        list.stream()
            .filter(num -> num % 5 == 0)

2.Can we define default method without using default keyword in Java8?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
    
<blockquote>

- No, for defining default method inside interface `default` keyword is must and it should prefix method declaration.
- Without prefixing default keyword results in compilation error.
- **Compile-time error**: Abstract methods do not specify a body.
- **Reason**: without default keyword, compiler consider it as abstract method which doesn’t have body.

- With Stream API, we can handle streams of data that can contain infinite number of elements.
- Collection API constructs objects in an eager manner.
- Stream API creates objects in a lazy manner.
- Multiple consumption: Most of the Collection APIs support iteration and consumption of elements multiple times.
- With Stream API we can consume or iterate elements only once.

In this example, we have used RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME because we want to demonstrate and read annotation at runtime.RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME indicates that annotations are to be recorded in the class file by the compiler and retained by the virtual machine at run time, so they may be read reflectively.

46.What is the difference between a predicate and a function?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<blockquote>

- A predicate takes one argument and returns a boolean value.
- A function takes one argument and returns an object.
- Both are useful for evaluating lambda expressions.

47.Can a functional interface extend/inherit another interface?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

A functional interface cannot extend another interface with abstract methods as it will void the rule of one abstract method per functional interface.

Example:

```Java
    interface Parent { 
        public int parentMethod(); 
    } 
    @FunctionalInterface // This cannot be FunctionalInterface 
    interface Child extends Parent { 
        public int childMethod(); 
            // It will also extend the abstract method of the Parent Interface 
            // Hence it will have more than one abstract method 
            // And will give a compiler error 
        }
```
It can extend other interfaces which do not have any abstract method and only have the default, static, another class is overridden, and normal methods.

48.What are the advantages of using the Optional class?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

It encapsulates optional values, i.e., null or not-null values, which helps in avoiding null checks, which results in better, readable, and robust code It acts as a wrapper around the object and returns an object instead of a value, which can be used to avoid run-time NullPointerExceptions.
