<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

JUnit helps to test individual pieces of code, or “units,” to ensure that they are functioning properly.By identifying and isolating units that are not working correctly, JUnit makes it easier to find and fix errors in code.In addition, JUnit can be used to automate the execution of unit tests, which can save time and effort.

<blockquote>

**Important features of JUnit are:**
- It is an open-source framework.
- Provides Annotation to identify the test methods.
- Provides Assertions for testing expected results.
- Provides Test runners for running tests.
- JUnit tests can be run automatically and they check their results and provide immediate feedback.
- JUnit tests can be organized into test suites containing test cases and even other test suites.
- JUnit shows test progress in a bar that is green if the test is going fine and it turns red when a test fails.

Next, we would test the installation.This would involve running sample tests (located not in the JUnit.jar file, but in the installation directory) distributed with JUnit.Lastly, we would confirm that all the tests pass with an “OK” message.If they don’t, we would go back and verify whether JUnit.jar is in the classpath.

Following are the steps to create parameterized tests in JUnit5:
- Declare `@ParameterizedTest` to the test.
- Declare at least one source (for example – `@ValueSource`) that will provide the arguments for each invocation of the test.
- Consume the arguments in the test method.
- JUnit 5 parameterized test maven dependency : We need `JUnit-jupiter-params` maven dependencies to support parameterized tests.

```Java
public class Junit5_Parameterized_Test {
  
  // This test will run sequentially 5 times with 1 argument each time
    @ParameterizedTest
    @ValueSource(ints = {8,4,2,6,10})
    void test_int_arrays(int arg) {
      System.out.println("arg => "+arg);
        assertTrue(arg % 2 == 0);

JUnit is more often used by developers to implement unit tests in JAVA. It is designed for unit testing that is more of a coding process and not a testing process.However, many testers and QA engineers use JUnit for unit testing.

JUnit is used because:

- It tests early and does automate testing.
- JUnit tests can be compiled with the build so that at the unit level, regression testing can be done.
- It allows test code re-usage.
- JUnit tests behave as a document for the unit tests when there is a transfer.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs.
- It helps the developers to understand the testing code base and enables them to make changes quickly.
- Good unit tests serve as project documentation.
- Unit tests help with code reuse.Migrate both your code and your tests to your new project.Tweak the code until the tests run again.

55.What is the purpose of Assumptions in JUnit5?

<blockquote>

Assumptions provide static methods to support conditional test execution based on assumptions.A failed assumption results in a test being aborted.

Assumptions are typically used whenever it does not make sense to continue the execution of a given test method.In the test report, these tests will be marked as passed.

The assumptions class has three methods with many overloaded forms:

`assumeFalse()`: validates the given assumption to be false.
`assumeTrue()`: validates the given assumption to be true.
`assumingThat()`: executes the supplied Executable, but only if the supplied assumption is valid.
```Java
@Test
void testOnDev()
{
    System.setProperty("ENV", "DEV");
    Assumptions.assumeTrue("DEV".equals(System.getProperty("ENV")));
    //remainder of the test will proceed
}

@Test
void testOnProd()
{
    System.setProperty("ENV", "PROD");
    Assumptions.assumeTrue("DEV".equals(System.getProperty("ENV")));
    //remainder of the test will be aborted
}
```

56.Can we have Non-Public test methods in JUnit 5?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<blockquote>

- JUnit 5 test classes and test methods are not required to be public.We can now make them package-protected.
- JUnit internally uses reflection to find test classes and test methods.Reflection can discover them even if they have limited visibility, so there is no need for them to be public.

57.What is the purpose of the `@RepeatedTest` annotation in JUnit 5?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

JUnit Jupiter provides the ability to repeat a test a specified number of times by annotating a method with `@RepeatedTest` and specifying the total number of repetitions desired.

Below is the example of `@RepeatedTest` in JUnit5.
```Java
@RepeatedTest(3)
void repeatedTestWithRepetitionInfo1(RepetitionInfo repetitionInfo) {
    assertEquals(3, repetitionInfo.getTotalRepetitions());
}
```
