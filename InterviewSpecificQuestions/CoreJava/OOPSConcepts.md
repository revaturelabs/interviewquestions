<blockquote>

- **O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming is a programming paradigm/model which revolves around the concept of **Objects**.
- Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that have **characteristics** and **behaviors**

**For example,**, if we consider a car, then based on the OOPs model:

- Class: A specific car model, such as Audi A4, BMW I8, Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, etc.
- Object: A specific car of any model, like the car you own
- Characteristics: What is the color of your car? What is the model of your car? etc.
- Behavior: How to start the car? How to change the gear of the car? etc.

Characteristics are also known as data, attributes, or properties, and Behaviors are also known as the functions, procedures, or methods, in the programming language.

- Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but with different parameters.
- It is also known as Compile-time Polymorphism or Static Polymorphism 

**For example,**: 
```java
public class SquaringDemo {
	
	public void square(int n) {
		System.out.println("Method with int argument called: " + n*n).
	}
	public void square(double n) {
		System.out.println("Method with double argument called: " +n*n);
	}
	public void square(float n) {
		System.out.println("Method with float argument called: " + n*n);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	  SquaringDemo obj = new SquaringDemo();
	  obj.square(4);
	  obj.square(4.567);

6.Explain Encapsulation.

  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

Encapsulation is the way of binding the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 

For example, in a company, they are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc.Consider a situation, a person from finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month.In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of sales section.He will first have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data.This is what encapsulation is.

In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

7.What is an abstract class?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Abstract Class allows us to achieve 0 - 100 % of abstraction in java.

A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class.It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).

A method that doesn't have its body is known as an abstract method.We use the same abstract keyword to create abstract methods.

We cannot create an object for abstract classes.Though abstract classes cannot be instantiated, we can create subclasses from it.We can then access members of the abstract class using the object of the subclass.

```java
abstract class Animal {
  //abstract method
  abstract void makeSound();
  //non abstract method
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("I can eat.");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {

  // provide implementation of abstract method
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Bark bark");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // create an object of Dog class
    Dog d1 = new Dog();

    d1.makeSound();
    d1.eat();
  }
}

8.Brief us on interfaces

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
 
Interface allow us to achieve 100% abstraction in java.An interface is declared by using the `interface` keyword.All the methods in an interface are abstract (declared with the empty body), and all the fields are `public`, `static` and `final` by default.

Like abstract classes, we cannot create objects of interfaces.

To use an interface, other classes must implement it.We use the `implements` keyword to implement an interface.A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.

```java
interface Polygon {
  void getArea(int length, int breadth);
}

// implement the Polygon interface
class Rectangle implements Polygon {

  // implementation of abstract method
  public void getArea(int length, int breadth) {
    System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is " + (length * breadth));
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle();
    r1.getArea(5, 6);
  }
}

10.What is Abstraction? or Describe abstract in OOP (or) What does Abstraction do?

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
 
Abstraction is an important concept of object-oriented programming that allows us to hide unnecessary details and only show the needed information.

A practical example of abstraction can be motorbike brakes.We know what brake does.When we apply the brake, the motorbike will stop.However, the working of the brake is kept hidden from us.

The major advantage of hiding the working of the brake is that now the manufacturer can implement brake differently for different motorbikes, however, what brake does will be the same.

**Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.**

There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
1.Abstract class (0 to 100% abstraction)
2.Interface (100% abstraction)

When we have the requirement of a class that contains some common properties or methods with some common properties whose implementation is different for different classes, in that situation, it's better to use Abstract Class then Interface.

Interfaces are a good choice when we think that the API will not change for a while.
Interfaces are also good when we want to have something similar to multiple inheritances since we can implement multiple interfaces.

The JDBC API is an excellent example.It exists of almost only interfaces.The concrete implementations are provided as "JDBC drivers".This enables you to write all the JDBC code independent of the DB vendor.You can just change the JDBC driver without changing any line of Java code (except of any hardcoded DB-specific SQL code) whenever you'd like to switch of DB vendor.
