<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

2.Can you tell the main interfaces, and what are the differences between them?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Set, List and Map are three important interfaces of the Java collection framework.
- A List can be used when the insertion order of elements needs to be maintained.
- We can use a set if we need to maintain a collection that contains no duplicates.
- And Map when data is key-value pairs and need fast retrieval of value based on some key.

3.Why is Map not inherited from the Collection interface, even though it is a component of the Java collection framework? 

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Because they are of an incompatible type.List, Set, and Queue are a collection of similar kind of objects but just values whereas a  Map is a collection of key and value pairs.

4.How do you remove an entry from a collection? And subsequently, what is the difference between the `remove()` method of a collection and the `remove()` method of an iterator? Which one will you use while removing elements during iteration?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Collection interface defines `remove(Object obj)` method to remove objects from `Collection.List` interface and adds another method `remove(int index)`, which is used to remove objects at a specific index.
- You can use any of these methods to remove an entry from Collection, while not iterating.
- Things change when you iterate.Suppose you are traversing a List and removing only certain elements based on logic, then you need to use Iterator's `remove()` method.
-This method removes the current element from Iterator's perspective.If you use Collection's or List's `remove()` method during iteration then your code will throw `ConcurrentModificationException`.
- That's why it's advised to use the iterator `remove()` method to remove objects from Collection.

5.How does HashSet use Hashing?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

HashSet extends `AbstractSet` and implements the Set interface.It creates a collection that uses a hash table for storage.A hash table stores information by using a mechanism called hashing.In hashing, the informational content of a key is used to determine a unique value, called its hash code.

6.How is HashSet implemented in Java?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

When we create an object of HashSet, it internally creates an instance of HashMap with default initial capacity 16.HashSet uses a constructor `HashSet(int capacity)` that represents how many elements can be stored in the HashSet.The capacity may increase automatically when more elements are to be stored

7.Which one do you prefer in Java between Array and Array Lists for storing objects and why?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Though ArrayList is also backed up by array, it offers some usability advantage over array in Java.Array is fixed length data structure, once created you can not change it's length.On the other hand,ArrayList is dynamic, it automatically allocate a new array and copies content of old array, when it resize.Another reason of using ArrayList over Array is support of Generics.

- No, Collection is a top-level interface of the Java collection framework whereas Collections is a utility class.The below table shows the difference between them.

- Collection:	
    - Collection is a root-level interface of the Java Collection Framework.
    - Most of the classes in the Java Collection Framework inherit from this interface.	
    - List, Set, and Queue are main sub-interfaces of this interface.	

- Collections:
    - Collections is a utility class in java.util package.
    - It consists of only static methods which are used to operate on objects of type Collection.
    -  `Collections.max()`, `Collections.min()`, `Collections.sort()` are some methods of Collections class.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

The Vector class is preferred over ArrayList class when you are developing a multi-threaded application.
But, precautions need to be taken because vector may reduce the performance of your application as it is 
Thread-safe and only one thread is allowed to have an object lock at any moment of time and the remaining threads have to wait until a thread releases the object lock.So, it is always recommended that if you don’t need thread safe environment, it is better the to use ArrayList class than the Vector class.And also Vector class is often considered as obsolete or “Due for Deprecation” by many experienced Java developers.They always recommend and advise not to the use Vector class in your code.They prefer using ArrayList over Vector class.

Advantages of using `emptySet()` method over creating an object using a constructor are :

1.Immutable: You should prefer to use immutable collections against mutable collections wherever possible.It becomes handy as multiple threads accessing the same instance of an object will see the same values.

2.Concise:  You do not need to manually type out the generic type of the collection - normally it is inferred from the context of the method call.


3.Efficient: As `emptySet()` method doesn’t create new objects, so they just reuse the existing empty and immutable object .Although, practically, this trick is not that handy, and rarely improves the performance

**HashSet:-**

- HashSet class implements the Set interface
- In HashSet, we store objects (elements or values) e.g.If we have a HashSet of string elements then it could depict a set of HashSet elements: {“Hello”, “Hi”, “Bye”, “Run”}
- HashSet does not allow duplicate elements that mean you cannot store duplicate values in HashSet.
- HashSet permits to have a single null value.
- HashSet is not synchronized which means they are not suitable for thread-safe operations until unless synchronized explicitly.

**HashMap:-**

- HashMap class implements the Map interface
- HashMap is used for storing key & value pairs.In short, it maintains the mapping of key & value (The  HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it is unsynchronized and permits nulls). 
- This is how you could represent HashMap elements if it has integer key and value of String type: e.g.{1->”Hello”, 2->”Hi”, 3->”Bye”, 4->”Run”}
- HashMap does not allow duplicate keys however it allows having duplicate values.
- HashMap permits single null key and any number of null values.
- HashMap is not synchronized which means they are not suitable for thread-safe operations until unless synchronized explicitly.

- HashSet gives better performance (faster) than TreeSet for the operations like add, remove, contains, size etc.HashSet offers constant time cost while TreeSet offers log(n) time cost for such operations.

- HashSet does not maintain any order of elements while TreeSet elements are sorted in ascending order by default.

47.What is difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

ArrayList and LinkedList both implements List interface and maintains insertion order.Both are non-synchronized classes.

|Sl.No |ArrayList               |LinkedList                                                                 |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  01.|ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.|LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.|
| 02.|Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array.If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory.	|Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.|
| 03.|An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.|	LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.|
| 04.| ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.|LinkedList is better for manipulating data.|

HashMap and Hashtable both are used to store data in key and value form.Both are using hashing technique to store unique keys.

|Sl.No|HashMap	              |Hashtable                                         |
|-----|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 01.|HashMap is **non synchronized**.It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code.|Hashtable is **synchronized**.It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.|
| 02.|HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.|Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.|
| 03.|HashMap is a new class introduced in JDK 1.2.|Hashtable is a legacy class.|
| 04.|HashMap is fast.      |Hashtable is slow.|
| 05.|We can make the HashMap as synchronized by calling this code Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(hashMap);|Hashtable is internally synchronized and can't be unsynchronized.|
| 06.|HashMap is traversed by Iterator.	|Hashtable is traversed by Enumerator and Iterator.|
| 07.|Iterator in HashMap is fail-fast.	|Enumerator in Hashtable is not fail-fast.        |
| 08.|HashMap inherits AbstractMap class.	|Hashtable inherits Dictionary class.             |

49.What is Comparable and Comparator Interface in java?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Comparable and Comparator both are interfaces and can be used to sort collection elements.

|Comparable	                |Comparator                                                                                |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1) Comparable provides a single sorting sequence.In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.|The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences.In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.|
|2) Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.|Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.|
|3) Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.| Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
|4) Comparable is present in java.lang package.|A Comparator is present in the java.util package.|
5) We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method.|We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by Collections.sort(List, Comparator) method.|
