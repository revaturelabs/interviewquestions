<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Log4j is a reliable, fast, and flexible logging framework (APIs) written in Java, which is distributed under the Apache Software License.
- Log4j has been ported to the C, C++, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby, and Eiffel languages.
- Log4j is highly configurable through external configuration files at runtime.It views the logging process in terms of levels of priorities and offers mechanisms to direct logging information to a great variety of destinations, such as a database, file, console, UNIX Syslog, etc.

- A well-written logging code offers quick debugging, easy maintenance, and structured storage of an application’s runtime information.
- Logging does have its drawbacks also.It can slow down an application.If too verbose, it can cause scrolling blindness.To alleviate these concerns, log4j is designed to be reliable, fast, and extensible.
- Since logging is rarely the main focus of an application, the log4j API strives to be simple to understand and to use.
