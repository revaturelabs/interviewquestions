21.Imagine you are working on a “Company” database having “Dept” as collection and inside your collection there are millions of documents and your boss is asking for some data from it, then what sort of practice you will do to increase the query performance and fast retrieval of data.

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> There are a few practices that one can follow to increase the query performance and fast retrieval of data:  
> 1.We can create and use the indexes on the fields that are frequently a part of the query.
> 2.While doing the find(), we can use projection to select only those fields that are required in the result.  
> 3.We can also use the limit() method to limit the data that we want in our result.

22.Consider your documents have some array fields and you want to create an index on it.Is it possible in MongoDB? 

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 
 
> Yes, it is possible to create index on an array field.MongoDB automatically creates the multikey index for each value of an array. For example, let’s take an array field which holds the values as address : [ "NY", "MIAMI","TEXAS"], we can create an index on that field by writing:    
`db.collection_name.createIndex({“address” : 1})`

</details>

23.What sort of practice you will take as a developer to increase the availability of data in MongoDB when there is a routine maintenance check or system failure?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> As a developer we must make sure that all the data are not present in one single server or machine.  
> -	We can distribute the data into different systems so, that if one system fails, we can get the data from other systems.  
> -	We can also distribute the data into multiple servers of one system so that we can easily use the other server in case of downtime of one server.

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> In the projection query, we cannot use a combination of 0 and 1.It should be either all 1 or all 0, except _id field value.So to get rid of that error we can re-write the query as:  
`db.collection.find({}, {_id: 0, name: 1, address: 1});`   
Here we are selecting an only name and address fields from the data.

36.As we know MongoDB is a Document oriented Database.What are the benefits document database gives over others?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> There are many advantages document database gives over Relational or other databases:    
> 1.They are schema-less.They don’t have any structure. 
> 2.No need to have a same number of fields in all the documents.Some may have > 4 fields while others may have 3 or 5 fields.
> 3.They have a replica set that contains duplicate data in it.So if one server fails we can still recover the data from other servers.  
> 4.All the documents can be independent of one another as they don't have a foreign keys concept.

39.Is creating Indexes in MongoDB always helpful?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> We cannot deny the fact that using indexes efficiently in MongoDB can increase query performance, But there are some disadvantages of indexes as well like:  
> - Each index that we create takes around 8 kB of space in memory.So, if we have many indexes that are not in use frequently will drain our resources.
> - Whenever we update or delete the documents, the indexes that are associated with that document also be updated.And these indexes updates hinder the write performance badly.

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg) 

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 
  
> `pretty()` when applied with the `find()` method, it will display output documents in an easy to read format.Without `pretty()` if the documents have so many fields and we fetched all the documents fields through `find()` then it is very difficult to read values from each document as it will show one document in one line only.

50.Explain about sharding in MongoDB?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 
  
> It is the process of adding data across multiple servers so that if one server is down we can still utilize the data from other servers.MongoDB supports sharding by breaking the larger datasets into smaller data sets and sending it to other servers.It increases the redundancy of data and provides durability in times of failure.

51.Explain the work of primary and secondary replica sets in MongoDB?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> - The primary replica set is a master replica that receives the write operations, on the other hand secondary replica set is used only for read operations.
> -  The primary replica set will always be one in the count, whereas secondary replica sets can be one or more than one.
> - Both primary and secondary replica sets provides the redundancy of data and at the time of failure of primary replica, one of the nearest secondary replica becomes the primary replica set and process remains unaffected.
> - After the write operation by primary replica node, the secondary replicas will replicate the data from primary through log files.

55.Does MongoDB stores data in JSON format or BSON format? And what is the difference between both, if any?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> MongoDB stores the data in BSON format.Although both JSON and BSON looks same still there is one difference between them:     
> - JSON is a text based format which stores the data in key-value pairs, on the other hand BSON is a binary format of JSON that provides efficient space in memory to store large data as well as it optimizes the speed to fetch the data from Memory.  
> Because of this only it becomes the ideal choice to store the data in BSON format.
