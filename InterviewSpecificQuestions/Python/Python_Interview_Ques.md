1.	How can you say that python is a dynamically typed programming language?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>
  
- Python is a dynamically typed programming language.It means that the type of the variable can be changed dynamically by the program at the run time, without re-declaration of the variable.
- In Python, we first define a variable a to hold an integer literal and later in the below program, without re-declaring it, we make it hold a string literal or 
  
```python
a = 43 # Integer literal 
print(f"{a} => {type(a)}") 
 
a = "Welcome to My Home" # String literal 
print(f"{a} => {type(a)}") 
```

3.	Jack wants to enter these multiple line values 5 2 3 4 1 into a single line and he is trying to order the list as [1,2,3,4,5].Which method helps him to get the values in python?
  
![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>
  
- If he wants to enter multiple line values into a single line, we can use 'list' separated by commas.
- If he wants to order the list means, we use the `sort()` method in python.
  
```python
values = [5,2,3,4,1 ]
print("list of values",values)
values.sort()
print("sorted values",values)
```

**Output:**
  
list of values [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]
sorted values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

4.	Consider you have a list which holds values of multiple datatypes how do you extract only the numbers from that lis?
  
![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)
  
<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>
  
- In a list, Python can contain different types of data, and an item in the list is separated by a comma and the entire list is enclosed in square brackets [].
- If we want to Extract only the numbers from the list, we can use `isinstance()` method through the loop `isinstance(int,float)`.Checking list contains numbers.If not, it contains int and float and it will store in another list, and we will print the list.

**Example**:
  
```python
list1 = ["a", 1, "b", 2, 3, 4, "c", "d"]
list2 = [val for val in list1 if isinstance(val, (int, float))]
print(list2)
```
  
**Output:**

[1, 2, 3, 4]

<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>

- A file is some information which is stored in the computer storage devices.Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default.You can do most of the file manipulation using a file object.Python language supports two types of files.
1.Text file 
2.Binary file

- Different modes for opening a file
     - `r` - open a file for reading.
     - `w` - open a file for reading.If the file exists, new file will be created.
     - `x` - open for exclusive creation, fail if the file already exists.
     - `a` - open for reading, appending to the end of the file that exists.
     - `b` - binary mode
     - `t` - text mode
     - `+r` - open a file for reading and writing.

43.Franz is asking to her junior to remove the duplicate values from a list.How is she going to get rid of duplicate elements from a list?
  
![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)
  
<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>

- To remove duplicate elements/values from a list, we can use the built-in function `set()`.The specification of `set()` method is, it will return only the distinct elements.
  
```python
duplicate_values = [1,1,2,3,2,2,4,5,6,2,1]
distinct_values = set(duplicate_values)
print("Before removing duplicate values:",duplicate_values)
print("After removing duplicate values",list(distinct_values))
```
  
**Output:**
  
Before removing duplicate values: [1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 1]
After removing duplicate values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>

- In Python, parameter passing mechanism is a call by value.
- The call-by-value method arguments that are passed by assignment in Python.The actual parameters to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called, arguments are passed using call by value.If you change the value of the parameter within a function, the change is reflected in the calling function.
 
  
```python
def func(a, b):
    a = 'new-value'        
    b = b + 1              
    return a, b            
x, y = 'old-value', 88     # assign values to a and b
x, y = func(x, y)         # function calling
print (x, y )

47.Can you explain the process of compilation and loading in python?
  
![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)
  
<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>

- In python, first it compiles a source code (.py file) into a byte code.Compiling is a simple translation step, and byte code is a lower-level and platform-independent source code.
- After compilation, it is usually stored in `.pyc` files.
- The bytecode (.pyc file) is loaded into the Python runtime and interpreted by a Python Virtual Machine, a piece of code that reads each instruction in the bytecode and executes whatever operation is indicated.The byte code compilation is automatic, and the PVM is just part of the Python system that you have installed on your machine.The PVM is always present as part of the Python system and is the component that truly runs your scripts.
- Each time an interpreted program is run, the interpreter must convert source code into machine code and pull in the runtime libraries.This conversion process makes the program run slower than a comparable program written in a compiled language.
- Python has something clever to improve the performance.It compiles to bytecode (.pyc files) the first time it executes a file.This substantially improves the execution of the code the next time the module is imported or executed.

- In python, `yield` keyword can be used like the return statement in a function.When done so, the function instead of returning the output, returns a generator that can be iterated upon.
- You can iterate through the generator to extract items.Iterating is done using a for loop or using the `next()` function.

```python
def Square(n):
  i = 1

<blockquote>

- An exception is a type of notification that interrupts the usual program execution.Exceptions help you to detect and react to unexpected events.The programâ€™s state is saved when an exception arises, and control is passed to an exception handler.The exceptions are thrown or raised by programming code that must send a signal to the executing program about an error or an unusual situation.

**For example**, when you want to open a file that doesnâ€™t exist, the code responsible for opening the file will detect this and throw an exception with a proper error message.Exceptions are of two types in OOPs, such as checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions.

 - **Checked exception** - The classes which inherit compile-time exceptions are known as checked exceptions.
 - **Unchecked exception** - The classes which inherit Runtime exceptions are known as unchecked exceptions.

- PYTHONCASEOK âˆ’ It is used in Windows to instruct Python and to find the first case-insensitive match in an import statement.Set this variable to any value to activate it.

- PYTHONHOME âˆ’ It is an alternative module search path.It is usually embedded in the PYTHONSTARTUP or PYTHONPATH directories to make switching module libraries easy.

- PYTHONPATH âˆ’ It has a role like PATH.This variable tells the Python interpreter where to locate the module files imported into a program.It should include the Python source library directory and the directories containing Python source code.PYTHONPATH is sometimes preset by the Python installer.

- As soon as the main thread exits, all threads are killed.Your main thread is running too quickly, giving the threads no time to do any work.A simple fix is to add a sleep to the end of the program that's long enough for all the threads to finish,
  
```python
import threading, time
def thread_task(name, n):
    for i in range(n):
        print (name, i)

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)
  
<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>
  
- Python doesnâ€™t have a switch/case statement because of some unsatisfactory proposals.
- Most of the programming languages have switch/case because they don't have proper mapping constructs.You cannot map a value to a function, that's why they have it.
- But in Python, you can easily have a mapping table(dict) where a certain value maps to a certain function.Python functions are first-class values, you can use the functions as the values of the dictionary get(key[, default]) method.Performance-wise, the Python dictionary lookup will almost certainly be more efficient than any solution you can rig yourself.

- Python supports methods, such as `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()`, that are very useful when you need to iterate over the items in a list, create a dictionary, or extract a subset of a list.

`filter()` â€“ enables you to extract a subset of values based on conditional logic.
`map()` â€“ it is a built-in function that applies the function to each item in an iterable.
`reduce()` â€“ repeatedly performs a pair-wise reduction on a sequence until a single value is computed.

<blockquote>
  
- This error occurs because we try to convert "7.4: to an integer.The value "7.4" is formatted as a string.Python cannot convert a floating-point number in a string to an integer.
- To overcome this issue, we need to convert the value a user inserts to a floating-point number.Then, we can convert it to an integer.
We can do this by using the `float()` and `int()` statements.The `int()` function returns an integer.The `float()` function returns a floating-point representation of a float.
- Finally, the code first converts the value of the variable to a float.Next, it will convert the value to an integer.

- Yes, it is possible.When min takes one argument, it assumes it to be an iterable, iterates over it and takes the minimum value.So,
  C  
```python

        self.a = a
        self.b = b
    def __iter__(self):
        yield self.a
        yield self.b
```  
  
- If you don't want to use `__iter__`.You want to create your own min function, that calls some _min_ method if there is one in the argument, it is passed to and calls the mini else.

```  
mini = min
def min(*args):
    if len(args) == 1 and hasattr(args[0], '_min_'):

print(obj.add(10, 20, 30))    # output: 60

- Python doesn't support method overloading but it supports method overriding.That is, we can define the same function in the child and parent class with the same signature and the child's function overrides the parent class function.But when we define multiple functions with the same name with different signatures and try to call both with a different number of arguments passing, it executes the latter one but gives an error for trying to call the other functions as in namespace there will always be a single entry against each function name.let's see this with an example.

 - After writing and calling the above two methods together, we are getting "TypeError: add() missing 1 required positional argument: 'c'".But if we commented the first calling function i.e add() with two arguments and call only the last function, it will execute and gives the output as 12.
  
```python
def add(a,b):
    return a+b 

def add(a,b,c):
    return a+b+c
# print(add(2,4))
print(add(2,4,6))   # output: 12 
```

198.Suppose there are three classes, Father, Mother and Child.The Child class inherits properties from two classes, Father and Mother class, then which type of inheritance can be depicted from the above scenario?
  
![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)
  
<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>

By the definition, Multiple inheritances state that one derived class can inherit properties from more than 1 base class.In the above scenario also, we can see that the Child class is a derived class which inherits all the properties from the 2 base classes, that is Father and Mother classes.

199.William asks "Polymorphism provides a default implementation of function overloading in python" to his junior.Is it true or false and give an explanation.
  
![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>

- False
- Suppose, if we define two functions with the same name and different argument lists in python, and when we try to call the first function, it will give an error in the program.But, when we try to call the second function, it doesn't give the error and overrides the prior function and generates the output.

200.Franz has a piece of code
  
```python
class Vehicle:
    def wheel(self):
        print("It can have 2 or more wheels")
        
class Car(Vehicle):
    def wheel(self):
        print("It has 4 wheels")

obj = Car()
obj
````
  
He is trying to run that, but he got some error can you help him to resolve the error and give the output of the code?

<blockquote>

- Correct code is mentioned below,
  
```python
class Vehicle:
    def wheel(self):
        print("It can have 2 or more wheels")
        
class Car(Vehicle):
    def wheel(self):
        print("It has 4 wheels")

obj = Car()
obj.wheel()
```

- Output for the above code is, `It can have 2 or more wheels`.
- Car class overrides the wheel() method of Vehicle class and therefore when calling the wheel() method of Car using the object of Car class, it prints the statement present inside it.

201.John is asking his friend if the len() function can be used in polymorphism in python.What would be the answer that he gives?
  
![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)
  
<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>

- In python, len() is used to find the length of different datatypes like string, list, tuple, etc.The below code will show how we can use len() function with different types of data.
  
```python
print(len("William"))           #Output: 6
print(len([1, 2, 3, 4]))       #Output: 4
print(len((1.5, 2.8, 3.3)))    #Output: 3 
```
  
- Different types of values are present in different print statements.First, it is a string, then it is a list, and at last, it is a tuple.The len() function returns the length of these values.

202.Ken asks his friend to run the following code.Tell me the output of the code and explain how he got that.
  
```python
x = 40
class Test:
    x =20 
    def show(self):
        print(x)
    
obj = Test()
print(x)
obj.show()
```

<blockquote>

- If I run the above code, I get output as 40
â€ƒ                                         40
-Before method calling, the first print statement prints the value of the global variable i.e 40.And when the show() method is called, the print statement present inside will also print the value of x as 40, not 20, because x= 20 is a class variable which must be accessed by using the class name before the variable name.Therefore, it will also take the global variable value i.e 40 in this case.

203.How do you differentiate between Interpreter and Compiler?
  
![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)
  
<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>

- The compiler translates our program in a single run, whereas the Interpreter translates our program line by line.
- In terms of CPU utilization, the Compiler utilizes more CPU than the Interpreter.
- During compilation, all the errors in the program are displayed in the end together, whereas in the Interpreter, errors of the code are displayed line by line.
- As the code size increases, the compiler takes more time to scan a code compared to Interpreters.
- Example: C, C++, java, etc are based on Compilers whereas Python, Ruby, MATLAB, etc.are interpreted languages.

204.Franz is asking his senior developer/lead if he/she can help him to find out whether these identifiers are valid or not.How would he help him? 
[Last_Name, student@id, 4_id, var, for]. 
  
![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)
  
<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>

- Last_Name and var are the only valid identifiers from the above list.
- student@id is not a valid identifier because it has a special character "@" in it.
- 4_id is not a valid identifier because the identifier should not start with a digit.
- for is invalid because it is a reserved word in python.

205.Consider your manager giving the following piece of code.
  
```python
list1 = [4, 2, 7, 3, 8, 9, 1]  
for i in list1:  
    # write your logic here
```
  
He asks you to write your own logic inside the for loop to print the values 4, 2, 7, 8, and 9 on the output screen.How will you do this?
  
![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)
  
<details><summary><b>Show Answer </b></summary>
<blockquote>

- The correct code is,
  
```python
list1 = [4, 2, 7, 3, 8, 9, 1]  
for i in list1:  
    if i%2==0 or i>3:
     print(i)
```
  
- i%2==0 is the condition for printing even numbers and i> 3 will take the value of i which is greater than 3 and there is a logical or operator between both the if conditions.Therefore, when either of the conditions becomes true only then the print statement inside if will executes.Hence, we get the result as 4, 2, 7, 8, and 9.
