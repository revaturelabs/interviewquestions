1.What are the constraints SQL follows in all their databases tool?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> In all the SQL databases there are some constraints like: 
> - not null: This constraint restricts the values that are null from being inserted into columns.
> - unique: This will allow only unique values in the column along with the null value
> - primary key: This constraint allows only those values that are not null and unique.
> - foreign key: This constraint helps in forming the relationship between two or more tables in SQL.
> - index: This constraint helps in improving query performance and fast retrieval of data
> - check: This is used when we have to check if all the data that is being inserted satisfy a condition.

2.How are primary key constraints and unique key constraints different? 

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> In a table in SQL, there can be many columns that can be a unique key but only one primary key is allowed on one table.The primary key is a combination of unique key plus null constraint, whereas unique key has only unique constraint and it can be null.

</details>

3.When creating a table in SQL, you forget to make a column as the primary key, then is there any possibility to create a primary key on that column or do we have to delete the table from the database so that we can create a primary key while creating a table?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> We can add the primary key after the creation of the table also, for that we can use the `alter` command that will add the primary key column to an existing table.There is no need to delete the table and recreate it again in the database.Just we have to pass a query as:  
```sql
alter table table_name add primary key(column_name);
```
  
</details>

       name varchar(30), 
       age int, 
       class varchar(10)
       );
```

</details>

5.While creating a table, how will you decide on the column that can be converted into primary key?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> There are set of rules that we can follow while creating a primary key:  
> 1.A column must have unique values.
> 2.A column shouldn't contain any null value.
> 3.Only one primary key can be created for one table.
> 4.Columns that are of type number are recommended for the primary key columns.

</details>

7.In SQL, what are the commands that are the part of Data Definition Language?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> Data Definition language or DDL commands are used to describe or define the structure of the database objects.In DDL, the following are the commands:  
> - create
> - alter
> - drop
> - truncate
> - comment
> - rename 

</details>

---

8.Is `drop` and `truncate` commands have the same usage in SQL?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> Both `drop` and `truncate` are part of DDL commands and also look similar while deleting records of the table in the database.But one major difference between both is that `drop` deletes all the records from the table as well as the table structure, whereas `truncate` will only delete all the records from the table but not the table structure.Also, the drop command can be used to delete the database, whereas truncate cannot be used to delete the database.

</details>

---

9.Suppose you have created a table called "student" with column fields as id, name, age, address and class.But now you want to rename the "id" column to "student_id", then how will you do that in SQL?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> Using `alter` command, we can rename the column name. 
```sql
alter table student 
rename column id to student_id;
```
> Here "id" column name is changed to "student_id" name.
</details>

---

10.How `rename` and `alter` command different from each other while renaming a table in SQL? 

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> `rename` command and `alter` both have similar working when renaming a table name in SQL except for the syntax.The only difference between both is that `rename` cannot be used to rename the temporary table, whereas `alter` command can rename a temporary table in SQL.

</details>

11.How normalization affects the performance in SQL?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> The main point to use the normalization forms in table data is to eliminate the repetition of data from it.So one thing we can do is say that it will guarantees the duplicate free data in the table.But achieving full normalization, it negatively affects the performance.

</details>

---

12.Tell me the difference in 1nf, 2nf and 3nf forms of normalization

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> - In 1nf or 1st normal form, the composite attribute is converted into a single-value attribute.Each column must only have one single data entry in each row.
> - In 2nf or 2nd normal form, the table should not have any partial dependency means the proper subset of the primary key shouldn't determine any non-prime attribute.
> - In 3nf or 3rd normal form, there should not be any transitive dependency, which means non-prime attribute of the table should not be dependent on another non- prime attribute.

</details>

---

13.Tell me about some of the benefits of normalization in SQL?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> - It is used to reduce or remove duplicates from the data.
> - To optimize storage space.
> - To prevent unwanted deletion of data.
> - To prevent data inconsistency.

</details>

---

14.Explain the different subsets of SQL?

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> In SQL, the Most common subsets are DDL, DML, DQL, DCL and TCL.

> - DDL allows the user to `create`, `alter` and `drop` objects of the database.
> - DML allows the user to manipulate the data in the database using  `insert`, `update` and `delete` commands.
> - DQL allows the user to fetch the data from the database using `select` command.
> - DCL commands like `grant` and `revoke` gives or remove permission to the user on the database elements.
> - TCL commands are used to control the data transaction using `commit`, `rollback` and `savepoint`.

       emp_id int,
       emp_name varchar(20),
       dept_id int,
       primary key (emp_id),
       foreign key (dept_id) references department(dept_id)
       );
```

</details>

---

16.Can a primary key and foreign key contain null? 

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> A primary key field in the table cannot contain null as a value.But that is not the case with a foreign key.A foreign key is used to stabilize a relation between two tables and it can contain a  null value.

</details>

---

17.Explain the anomalies and their types?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> Anomaly generally happens when the database is not constructed well and when the normalization concepts were not applied.There are 3 types of anomalies that cause a problem:  
> 1.insertion anomaly: This can happen when we are trying to insert the data into the table, and it is not allowed because some data is not present.
> 2.update anomaly: This will happen when we have duplicate data in the table and updating one of those data will not reflects toe other data and the end user has no idea which data is the correct one.
> 3.deletion anomaly: This will happen when the deletion of one data will cause other data to be deleted from the table as well.

```
With `alter`
```sql
alter table emp
rename to employee; 
```

54.Tell me about the joins in SQL and their types.

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)  

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

> Joins, in SQL, are useful to combine records of two or more different tables.
> We have various types of joins like:  
> - Inner Join: After join, it returns matching rows of both tables only.
> - Outer Join: After join, it returns matching rows of both the tables plus left out rows of left table and right table.
> - left Join: It returns matching rows of both the tables plus left out rows from the left table.
> - right Join: It returns matching rows of both the tables plus left out rows from the right table.

60.Tell the difference between union and full join in SQL?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)
  
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

> - Union joins the two-table data vertically, whereas full join joins the two table data horizontally.
> - There are more restrictions when using a union between two tables than using full join.
> - Union will take only distinct values from both tables, whereas full join combines all the data from both tables.

71.In SQL, what are the points anyone has to keep in mind when using `group by` clause in SQL?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

> Points to remember when using `group by` clause:  
> - Use `group by` clause with a select query
> - If `where` clause is used in the query, `group by` clause must be placed after it.
> - If `order by` clause is used in the query, `group by` clause must be placed before it.
> - Columns mentioned in the select query should either be part of the group by clause or an aggregation function is applied to those columns.

> The relationship between the two tables is established by the primary key- the foreign key.This foreign key constraint is also called a referential integrity constraint.The value of the foreign key is derived from the primary key of another table.    
> In SQL there is two referential integrity constraint presents:  
> - Insert Constraint: That says, we cannot insert values in a foreign key table if the value is not present in the primary key table.
> - Delete Constraint: That says, we cannot delete any value from the primary key table if the value is present in the foreign key table.
