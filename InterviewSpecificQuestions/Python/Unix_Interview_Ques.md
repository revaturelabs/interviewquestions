38. To view the content of a small file we can use the `cat` command, but what will happen if we use the same `cat` command to view the content of a large file?  Also, tell me which command can be used to see the content of a large file in a more convenient way.

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> When we use the `cat` command to see the content of a large file that will not be fixed in a single terminal screen, then it will move the cursor to the end of the file and to view the content from the start of the file we have to scroll it up. Therefore, it is not a convenient way to see the content of a large file. But, for that, there is a command called `more` through which we can see the content of a file in a convenient way. It will not move directly to the end of the file, instead, it stops at the end of the terminal with a prompt message at the bottom of the terminal showing how much content is present in the terminal at that moment in terms of percentage. We can press enter key to move down line by line and for scrolling down we can use the space key.

</details>

39. Both `more` and `less` command in Linux, is used to view the content of a large file then what is the difference between both of them?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> The `more` command, when used to see the content of a big file, allows the user to scroll down only with limited or no scroll up. Whereas the `less` command is used for both forward and backward navigation in a file.

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary> 

> To terminate or end a process, we can use the `kill` command in Linux.  
```
kill -15 3007

```
Here, -15 represents a termination signal.
