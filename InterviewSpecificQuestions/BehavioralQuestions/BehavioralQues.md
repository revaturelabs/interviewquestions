1.What makes you excited or passionate about software development?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample Answer 1: I want to be a software developer because designing computer programs lets me use my creative and problem-solving skills. Software development wasn't my initial career path, but I'm glad I discovered it. In college, I originally studied communications. After obtaining my bachelor's degree in communications, I accepted a job as an editor at a publishing firm. I was responsible for correcting grammatical and stylistic mistakes in clients' work. While I was good at my job and worked hard, the position didn't excite me, so I searched for something more fulfilling. I learned more about the subject via online resources and began to teach myself basic concepts. Eventually, I earned a bachelor's degree in computer science. I enjoyed the challenges that my education presented, and I'm very excited to work as a professional software developer and use the versatile skills that this career demands.

Sample answer 2: I am a Mathematics student. In my eyes, Mathematics is the tool used by the nature to communicate with humans. Similarly, programming is the tool used by humans to communicate with computers. It feels like a great achievement when you finally get the code right after weeks of debugging. Seriously, those who have never done programming will never know the feeling. It feels like a savior when you figure out and implement the edge cases beforehand. In short, programming is challenging, gives me thrills, gives a workout to my brain. That’s why I’m passionate about programming.

Sample Answer: 
Lack of clarity.
Trust issues.
Personality conflicts.
Withholding information.
Lack of communication
Reduced engagement.
Excessive staff numbers.
Interior competition.
Sample scenario: When I was working with a team of 10 people on a project of content creation, everyone had multiple opinions about executing the task. At times, it led to personal conflicts as well. We, as a team, decided to talk about this and come up with a common strategy that everyone supports and we were successful in accomplishing that. Initially, we had struggles to come up with a common solution due to communication barriers but we figured out ways to resolve and the task is successfully executed.

7.You are on a client project when someone client-facing approached you about a bug and is holding you responsible for the bug that you did not know existed. After some investigation, you find out that your most recent 
build did not cause the bug. How would you handle or approach this situation?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
If you are an ethical and empathetic person you own up to this and let the chips fall where they may. You need to ensure that when you notify your client of the fault, you also inform them of how this mistake occurred and how it will never occur again with documented changes in processes and tests to catch any similar issue in the future. Even though the broken code is from someone else and you are not at fault, do not come up with reasons defending your part. Instead, try to take the responsibility and come up with solutions to resolve this problem. That way, you portray yourself as a good and responsible team player.

9.What are your strengths and weaknesses?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample Answer: To state my strength and weakness can be a little confusing because both two concepts are the same for me. My quality of being self-motivated. I can work hard and consistently to achieve a goal if that helps me in growing and learn. I can motivate myself to do a task even when there are multiple obstacles, and I can complete it. However, my weakness is being over-self-motivated cause in that process I lose myself and get too goal-oriented it is a team task then my self-goals become a burden for them and as a result, I come across clashes and group breakdowns. I have been working on this for the last few months where I set a limit for myself and for the team and try not to affect my goals and objectives becomes the pressure for others.

(For the most part, strengths should include your soft skills. This question is mostly asked to check a candidate’s behavioral skills, your technical skills are tested in your technical interview. No, mentioning your weakness will not affect your performance negatively. However, saying that you have no weaknesses will make you sound arrogant.)

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>

Sample Answer:  "I participated in a fellowship program over the summer as a part of my studies. Through the program, I was able to conduct a research project of my own using university resources, like the library's special collections archive, to support my work. I worked alongside three other fellows who were taking part in the program and conducting their own projects. We collaborated while forming our research questions, and one of my coworkers was particularly negative about my approach to my project. I wanted to understand her concerns, so I asked her about them in one of our collaborative meetings.
Unfortunately, she avoided my question. Afterward, I spoke with my research mentor and asked for her guidance. My mentor advised me to speak with my coworker privately, so I invited her to get coffee with me later that day. During our conversation, I asked for her feedback about my project. I realized she was planning on using the same archive as me to support her research and had concerns regarding the availability of the space and resources. I reassured her that she would have access as well, and together we created a schedule that worked for the both of us."

Sample Answer: “When I started my first internship, I was overly eager to go the extra mile. I agreed to take on unrealistic deadlines with coworkers.

<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample answer 1: At my current job, a client called late Friday afternoon with an urgent question about their project status. Usually my boss directly interacts with our clients, but he'd already left for the weekend. I told the client that while I might not know the exact answer, I could possibly help because I was also working on the project. The client was fine with that. We worked through the question together, and I was able to provide enough information that the client felt the rest could wait until Monday. I left a detailed note for my boss asking him to check in with the client on Monday.

Sample answer 2: When the software development of our new product stalled, I coordinated the team that managed to get the schedule back on track. We were able to successfully troubleshoot the issues and solve the problems, within a very short period, and without completely burning out our team. I was able to do this by motivating the senior engineering team to brainstorm a technologically innovative solution that would solve the customer’s issues with fewer development hours on our end.

Sample answer 1: I had a colleague who always wanted things done his way, invariably getting into confrontations with many co-workers. I had to team up with him on a month-long social media campaign to develop creative post ideas and strategically schedule them for maximum reach and engagement. I was tactful and kept my cool throughout. When we disagreed, I heard him out. If I still believed that my idea was better, I supported it with enough data and proven theories to convince him. Ultimately, the campaign was a success, and my colleague came to respect me greatly.

Sample answer 2: A team member was finding it difficult to contribute because they were unclear as to what their role was. I helped resolve the situation by creating a more detailed work plan that specified each member's role and responsibilities on the project.

Sample answer 1: Most of my professional experience has led me up to this administrative secretary role. I’ve been working in the field for almost ten years now. I got my first position as an office assistant when I was 18 – a position that required a lot of communication with both co-workers and customers. I’m interested in this position specifically because it would allow me to expand my leadership potential and continue working in an environment that I have a great deal of experience in.

Sample answer 2: The last time I worked as a language assistant, I found the work interesting but sometimes hard. I learned a lot from my work experience. On one occasion I found two boys fighting in the playground. I managed to calm them down by being calm myself. I asked them what had happened and helped them to resolve their fight themselves. I thought that in a situation like that I would get angry myself, and perhaps take sides, but I did not.  I think that this was a great lesson for me.

2. Check your mindset
3. Empathize with the players

Sample answer: In my last job, I had to do quite a bit of problem solving related to our shift scheduling. We had four people quit within a week and the department was severely understaffed. I coordinated a ramp-up of our hiring efforts, I got approval from the department head to offer bonuses for overtime work, and then I found eight employees who were willing to do overtime this month. I think the key problem-solving skills here were taking initiative, communicating clearly, and reacting quickly to solve this problem before it became an even bigger issue.

Sample answer 1: Once, a co-worker and I disagreed on the way an unsatisfied customer was dealt with. I decided to meet with them one on one to talk and resolve our dispute in a peaceful manner. We both agreed that our goal was to keep the customer happy and came to a compromise that consisted of both of our ideas.

Sample answer 2: I’ve learned that disagreements and conflicts are part of work whether I like it or not. I’ve also learned that, without conflict, there’s no progress. So, if a conflict arises, that means there’s room for progress and scope for improvement in that space. I must tread carefully and take it slowly so as not to offend others or complicate circumstances. I take enough time to assess the situation and once I gain a clear understanding of the situation, I will take care of them to resolve the conflict.

I overcame that fear, and through my strong leadership and interpersonal skills, we received a good rating of employee satisfaction on our most recent survey.

The best way to answer this question is to talk about a specific example of a time you made a mistake: Briefly explain what the mistake was, but don't dwell on it. Quickly switch over to what you learned or how you improved, after making that mistake.

Sample Answer: One thing I have learned from past mistakes is when to ask for help. I have learned that it is far better to ask for clarification and solve an issue right away than to be unsure. I know that your company emphasizes teamwork and the need to be in constant communication with one another, and I think my ability to ask (and answer) questions of my peers would help me fit in very well with your company culture.
