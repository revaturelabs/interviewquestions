<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample Answer 1: I want to be a software developer because designing computer programs lets me use my creative and problem-solving skills.Software development wasn't my initial career path, but I'm glad I discovered it.In college, I originally studied communications.After obtaining my bachelor's degree in communications, I accepted a job as an editor at a publishing firm.I was responsible for correcting grammatical and stylistic mistakes in clients' work.While I was good at my job and worked hard, the position didn't excite me, so I searched for something more fulfilling.I learned more about the subject via online resources and began to teach myself basic concepts.Eventually, I earned a bachelor's degree in computer science.I enjoyed the challenges that my education presented, and I'm very excited to work as a professional software developer and use the versatile skills that this career demands.

Sample answer 2: I am a Mathematics student.In my eyes, Mathematics is the tool used by the nature to communicate with humans.Similarly, programming is the tool used by humans to communicate with computers.It feels like a great achievement when you finally get the code right after weeks of debugging.Seriously, those who have never done programming will never know the feeling.It feels like a savior when you figure out and implement the edge cases beforehand.In short, programming is challenging, gives me thrills, and gives a workout to my brain.That’s why I’m passionate about programming.

9.	What are your strengths and weaknesses?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample Answer: To state my strength and weakness can be a little confusing because both two concepts are the same for me.My quality of being self-motivated.I can work hard and consistently to achieve a goal if that helps me in growing and learning.I can motivate myself to do a task even when there are multiple obstacles, and I can complete it.However, my weakness is being over-self-motivated cause in that process I lose myself and get too goal-oriented it is a team task then my self-goals become a burden for them and as a result, I come across clashes and group breakdowns.I have been working on this for the last few months where I set a limit for myself and the team and try not to affect my goals and objectives and become the pressure for others.

(For the most part, strengths should include your soft skills.This question is mostly asked to check a candidate’s behavioral skills, your technical skills are tested in your technical interview.No, mentioning your weakness will not affect your performance negatively.However, saying that you have no weaknesses will make you sound arrogant.)

Unfortunately, she avoided my question.Afterward, I spoke with my research mentor and asked for her guidance.My mentor advised me to speak with my coworker privately, so I invited her to get coffee with me later that day.During our conversation, I asked for her feedback about my project.I realized she was planning on using the same archive as me to support her research and had concerns regarding the availability of the space and resources.I reassured her that she would have access as well, and together we created a schedule that worked for the both of us."

Sample answer 2: I’ve learned that disagreements and conflicts are part of work whether I like it or not.I’ve also learned that, without conflict, there’s no progress.So, if a conflict arises, that means there’s room for progress and scope for improvement in that space.I must tread carefully and take it slowly so as not to offend others or complicate circumstances.I take enough time to assess the situation and once I gain a clear understanding of the situation, I will take care of them to resolve the conflict.

The best way to answer this question is to talk about a specific example of a time you made a mistake: Briefly explain what the mistake was, but don't dwell on it.Quickly switch over to what you learned or how you improved, after making that mistake.

Sample Answer: One thing I have learned from past mistakes is when to ask for help.I have learned that it is far better to ask for clarification and solve an issue right away than to be unsure.I know that your company emphasizes teamwork and the need to be in constant communication with one another, and I think my ability to ask (and answer) questions of my peers would help me fit in very well with your company culture.
