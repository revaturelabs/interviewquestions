The CSS box model is a rectangular layout paradigm for HTML elements that consists of the following:

**Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear
**Padding** - A transparent area surrounding the content (i.e., the amount of space between the border and the content)
**Border** - A border surrounding the padding (if any) and content
**Margin** - A transparent area surrounding the border (i.e., the amount of space between the border and any neighboring elements)

- Inline CSS has the highest priority, then comes Internal/Embedded followed by External CSS which has the least priority.Multiple style sheets can be defined on one page.If for an HTML tag, styles are defined in multiple style sheets then the below order will be followed.

- As Inline has the highest priority, any styles that are defined in the internal and external style sheets are overridden by Inline styles.

- Internal or Embedded stands second in the priority list and overrides the styles in the external style sheet.

- External style sheets have the least priority.If there are no styles defined either in the inline or internal style sheet, then external style sheet rules are applied for the HTML tags.

CSS3 element selector helps to find out the HTML elements name which we want to apply in a style sheet.It has five categories.They are

`Attribute Selectors`: Find an attribute or attribute value of an HTML element.
`Combinator Selectors`: Find a specific relationship between elements.
`Simple Selectors`: Find a name, id, or class of an element.
`Pseudo Class Selectors`: Find a certain state of an element.
`Pseudo Elements Selectors`: Find the style part and select an element.

Example:

```CSS
P {
text-align: left;
Color: blue
```
In the output element P will be left aligned with the blue text color.

- Yes.Flexbox is mainly meant for 1-dimensional layouts while Grid is meant for 2-dimensional layouts.

- Flexbox solves many common problems in CSS, such as vertical centering of elements within a container, sticky footer, etc.Bootstrap and Bulma are based on Flexbox, and it is probably the recommended way to create layouts these days.Have tried Flexbox before but ran into some browser incompatibility issues (Safari) in using flex-grow, and I had to rewrite my code using inline-blocks and math to calculate the widths in percentages, it wasn't a nice experience.

- Grid is by far the most intuitive approach for creating grid-based layouts (it better be!) but browser support is not wide at the moment.

10.What is DOM (Document Object Model) and how is it linked to CSS?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent application programming interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.

With the Document Object Model, programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content.The DOM specifies interfaces which may be used to manage XML or HTML documents.

When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information.The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model).The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory.It combines the document's content with its style.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
- For example, it can be used to:
  - Style an element when a user mouses over it.
  - Style visited and unvisited links differently.
  - Style an element when it gets focus.
  - Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.
  - Pseudo-classes can be combined with HTML classes.

- When you hover over the link in the example, it will change color:

```CSS
    selector:pseudo-class {
    property: value;
    }
    Like 
    /* mouse over link */
    a:hover {
    color: #FF00FF;

<blockquote>

**Grid and flexbox**.The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column.Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.

```CSS
<div class="wrapper">
  <div>One</div>
  <div>Two</div>
  <div>Three</div>
  <div>Four</div>
  <div>Five</div>
</div>

.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);

Flex Example :

```CSS
.wrapper {
  width: 500px;
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
.wrapper > div {
  flex: 1 1 150px;

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

If we are using flexbox and find yourself disabling some of the flexibility, we probably need to use CSS Grid Layout.An example would be if we are setting a percentage width on a flex item to make it line up with other items in a row above.In that case, a grid is likely to be a better choice.

Use a grid when we already have the layout structure in mind, and flex when we just want everything to fit.

21.Which one of these units would you prefer: `px, em, % or pt` and why?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

It depends on what we are trying to do.

**px** gives fine grained control and maintains alignment because 1 px or multiple of 1 px is guaranteed to look sharp.px is not cascade, this means if parent font-size is 20px and child 16px.child would be 16px.

**em** maintains relative size.we can have responsive fonts.em is the width of the letter 'm' in the selected typeface.However, this concept is tricky.1em is equal to the current font-size of the element or the browser default.if we sent font-size to 16px then 1em = 16px.The common practice is to set default body font-size to 62.5% (equal to 10px).em is cascade

**%** sets font-size relative to the font size of the body.Hence, we have to set font-size of the body to a reasonable size.this is easy to use and does cascade.for example, if parent font-size is 20px and child font-size is 50%.child would be 10px.

**pt(points)** are traditionally used in print.1pt = 1/72 inch and it is fixed-size unit.

22.How do absolute, relative, fixed, and static position differ?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

**absolute**, place an element exactly where we want to place it.absolute position is actually set relative to the element's parent.if no parent available then relatively place to the page itself.

**relative**, is position an element relative to itself (from where the element would be placed, if we don't apply relative positioning).for example, if we set position relative to an element and set top: 10px, it will move 10px down from where it would be normally.

**fixed**, element is positioned relative to viewport or the browser window itself.viewport doesn't changed if we scroll and hence fixed element will stay right in the same position.

**static**, element will be positioned based on the normal flow of the document.usually, we will use position static to remove other position might be applied to an element.

`auto` - Browsers use an automatic table layout algorithm.The column width is set by the widest unbreakable content in the cells.The content will dictate the layout.
`fixed` - The layout is fixed based on the first row.Set the width of those, and the rest of the table follows.If no widths are present on the first row, the column widths are divided equally across the table, regardless of content inside the cells.
`initial` - Sets this property to its default value.

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Both responsive and adaptive design attempt to optimize the user experience across different devices, adjusting for different viewport sizes, resolutions, usage contexts, control mechanisms, and so on.

Responsive design works on the principle of flexibility — a single fluid website that can look good on any device.Responsive websites use media queries, flexible grids, and responsive images to create a user experience that flexes and changes based on a multitude of factors.Like a single ball growing or shrinking to fit through several different hoops.

Adaptive design is more like the modern definition of progressive enhancement.Instead of one flexible design, adaptive design detects the device and other features, and then provides the appropriate feature and layout based on a predefined set of viewport sizes and other characteristics.The site detects the type of device used and delivers the pre-set layout for that device.Instead of a single ball going through several different-sized hoops, we’d have several different balls to use depending on the hoop size.

**Normalizing**— preserves useful default styles rather than “unstyling” everything.It also corrects bugs for common browser dependencies.
It's a good idea to choose resetting when we have very a customized or unconventional site design such that we need to do a lot of our own styling do not need any default styling to be preserved.

A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).They can be used for decoration (`:first-line, :first-letter`) or adding elements to the markup (combined with content: ...) without having to modify the markup (`:before, :after`).

Example of usage:

- `:first-line and :first-letter` can be used to decorate text.
- Used in the `.clearfix` hack to add a zero-space element with clear: both.
- Triangular arrows in tooltips use `:before and :after`.Encourages separation of concerns because the triangle is considered part of styling and not really the DOM, but not really possible to draw a triangle with just CSS styles.

The **clear** property is directly related to the float property.It specifies if an element should be next to the floated elements or if it should move below them.This property applies to both floated and non-floated elements.

**CSS Syntax:**

```css
clear: none|left|right|both|inherit|inline-start|inline-end;
```

**Property Values:**

|Value       |Description	                                       |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|none	       |The element is not moved down to clear past floats.|
|left	       |The element is moved down to clear past left floats.|
|right	     |The element is moved down to clear past right floats.|
|Both 	     |The element is moved down to clear past both left and right floats.|

      However, since div1 is floated to the left, this happens: the text in div2 is floated 
      around div1, and div2 surrounds the whole thing.

41.How a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Browsers match selectors from rightmost (key selector) to left.Browsers filter out elements in the DOM according to the key selector and traverse up its parent elements to determine matches.The shorter the length of the selector chain, the faster the browser can determine if that element matches the selector.

For example with this selector p span, browsers firstly find all the `<span>` elements and traverse up its parent all the way up to the root to find the `<p>` element.For a particular `<span>`, as soon as it finds a `<p>`, it knows that the `<span>` matches and can stop its matching.

44. What is the difference between padding and margin?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

**1) Margin** is applied to the outside of your element hence effecting how far your element is away from other elements. 
**2) Padding** is applied to the inside of your element hence effecting how far your element\'s content is away from the border.

Also, using margin will not affect your element\'s dimensions whereas padding will make your elements dimensions (set height + padding) so for example if you have a 100x100px div with a 5 px padding, your div will actually be 105x105px

```CSS
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/padding-margin.png" alt="Padding vs Margin" width="600px" />
</p>
```
*Note:* **Top/Bottom margins are collapsible:** if you have a 20px margin at the bottom of an element and a 30px margin at the top of the next element, the margin between the two elements will be 30px rather than 50px.This does not apply to left/right margin or padding.

45.How is the concept of inheritance applied in CSS?


![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Inheritance is a concept in which the child class will inherit the properties of its parent class.It is used in CSS to define the hierarchy from the top level to the bottom level.Inherited properties can be overridden by the children class if the child uses the same name.

**Example:**

```CSS
span {
  color: blue;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
.extra span {
  color: inherit;
}
```

46.How does Calc() work?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

The `calc()` function can be used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division calculations with numeric property values.Specifically, it can be used with `<length>`, `<frequency>`, `<angle>`, `<time>`, `<number>`, or `<integer>` data types.

**Example:**

```css
/* Example - 1 */
.main-content {
  width: calc(100vh - 10px); /* Subtract 10px from 100vh */
}

/* Example - 2 */
.container {
  padding: calc(1vw + 1em);
  width: calc(var(--variable-width) + 200px);
  transform: rotate( calc(1turn + 28deg) );
  background: hsl(100, calc(3 * 20%), 40%);
  font-size: calc(50vw / 3);
  border-radius: 15px calc(15px / 3) 4px 2px;
}
```
