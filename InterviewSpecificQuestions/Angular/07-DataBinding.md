Using String Interpolation, we can print the `name` in the template.In `app.component.html`, 
```html
{{ name }}
```

In `app.component.html`, create a button and have `Click Me` enclosed with the `<button>` tag.When the user clicked on the button, we should greet the user with the message "Welcome to my angular app".We need data binding.
	
```html
<button (click)="onClick()"> Click Me</button>	
```

- From view to component
- Bind DOM events such as keystrokes, button clicks, mouseovers, touches, etc.to a function in the component.
- Uses (), parentheses in the HTML file
- Here, we were calling the `OnClick()` function, when the ‘Click Here’ button is clicked.

7.Do you know about two-way data binding in angular? If so, explain.

<blockquote>

- Two-way data binding is achieved by combining property binding and event binding.
- Mostly used in forms.
- Angular uses the `ngModel` directive to achieve two-way binding on HTML `<form>` elements.
- To use the `ngModel` directive, we need to import the `FormsModule` package into our Angular module.
- Here, we enclose the `ngModel` directive within [()]

8.What is the difference between property and attribute in angular?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>
For example, if we take below `<input>` tag:	
	
```html
<input type="text" id="name" value="John">
```
	
Here we have an `<input>` tag set value as "John".It's the initial value. 

In the console of a browser if we execute,
	
```js	
name.getAttribute('value') //attribute value gives John

name.value  // property value also gives John
```
	
Let's say the user enters/changes to  "Jim" in this input textbox.
	
```js
name.getAttribute('value') // attribute value gives Jim

name.value  // property value also gives Jim	
```
**NOTE:** Attributes initialize DOM properties.Once initialization is complete attribute job is done.Properties value can change whereas attribute value cannot change
