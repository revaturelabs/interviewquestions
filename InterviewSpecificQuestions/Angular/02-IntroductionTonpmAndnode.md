<blockquote>

- We use Node.js and npm as tools for building Angular or React apps. 
- Angular is a front-end framework used to create a web application and is written in **Typescript**. 
- The **browser only understands JavaScript code**, so we need to compile Typescript (.ts file) to plain JavaScript (.js file). 
- We use Node.js and npm to perform this compilation, then we can deploy them in production.
