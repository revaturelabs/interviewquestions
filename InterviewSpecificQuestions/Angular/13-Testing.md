Karma is a task runner for our tests. It allows the users to execute their Jasmine test codes in multiple real-time browsers from the command line. This command line also displays the result of the tests. It watches the files for changes and re-runs the tests automatically. By default, Angular runs on Karma.

The Angular testing package includes two utilities called `TestBed` and `async`. `TestBed` is the main utility package. 

There are three main methods in this test file:

- `describe()` – It’s a suite of Test scripts that calls a global Jasmine function with two parameters: a string and a function. It also consists of beforeEach block.
- `it()` – It’s the smallest unit test case that is written to be executed, which calls a global Jasmine function with two parameters: a string and a function. Multiple `it()` statements can be written inside the `describe()`
- `expect()` – Every `it()` statement has a `expect()` function which takes a value and expects a return in true form
