<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- TypeScript is an attempt to fix JavaScript problems.
- Since we all know that JavaScript is the only language used in client-side scripting browsers can only understand JavaScript.
- Since TypeScript simplifies JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug.It saves developers time and increases productivity.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Advantages of using TypeScript:

- Integrates well with React, Vue, and Angular.
- Is a statically typed language and this makes the code easier to refactor.
- Is easier to read and access.Helps in code maintainability.
- Has a powerful type system, including generics.
- Statically typed programming languages are those in which the type of a variable is known at compile-time instead of at run-time.

- The Built-in types include string, number, boolean, undefined, null, and void.
- The User-defined types include array, enum, interface, class, union, and tuple.

10.What are typed functions in TypeScript?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

In Typescript, a function can be created as a named function or an anonymous function.We can further add types to each of the parameters of the function as well.

```ts

// Named function
function add(a: number, b: number) : number {
    return a + b;
}

// Anonymous function
let funcAdd = function(a: number, b: number): number { return a + b; };
```

If we want to write the full type of the function:

```ts

let funcAdd: (a: number, b: number) => number = 
     function (a: number, b: number) : number  { return a + b; };
```

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

There are 3 types of access modifiers in TypeScript: public, private, and protected.

**Public**:
By default, all the members of a class are public in TypeScript.

**Private**:
When any of the class members are declared private, it is only accessible within the class scope.

**Protected**:
The protected members are similar to private access modifiers, except that they are accessible in the derived class.

15.Can you explain the Rest parameters in Typescript?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Sometimes, we want to work with multiple parameters as a group, or we may not know how many parameters a function will ultimately take.In JavaScript, we have something known as arguments.Similarly, we have Rest parameters in typescript.

- Rest parameters are treated as a boundless number of optional parameters.The compiler will build an array of the arguments passed in with the name given after the ellipsis (…)

```ts

function getPlayersList(name:string, ...players: string[]) {
    return name + " " + players.join(" ");
}

let players = getPlayersList("Virat", "MS", "Warner", "Kane", "Ben")

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Generics in Typescript is no different from generics in other programming languages like Java.
- We can create a class, an interface, or a function that works with different types, without specifying the type upfront.

```ts

function greet(a : T) {
  console.log(`Hi ${a}!`)
}

greet('DS'); //function call

```
- The symbol T identifies a generic type.

24.Explain the need for a TypeScript Definition Manager?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- TypeScript Definition Manager (TSD) is a package manager used to search and install typescript definition files directly from the community-driven DefinitelyTyped repository.
- Now, if we want to use some jQuery code in your .ts file:

```ts

$(document).ready(function() { //Your jQuery code });

```
- Here, when we try to compile it by using tsc, it will give a compile-time error: Cannot find the name “$”.
- So, we need to inform the TypeScript compiler that “$”belongs to jQuery.
- To do this, TSD comes into play.We can download the jQuery Type Definition file and include it in our .ts file.

- To debug any TypeScript file, we need a .js source map file.So, we have to compile the .ts file with the –source map flag to generate a source map file.
```ts

$ tsc -source map filename.ts

```
- This will create a filename.js and filename.js.map.And the last line of filename.js would be a reference to the source map file.

```ts

//# sourceMappingURL=filename.js.map

<blockquote>

- An `interface` is a virtual structure that only exists within the context of TypeScript.The TypeScript compiler uses interfaces only for type-checking purposes.

<blockquote>

- If we need/wish to create an instance of perhaps a custom object, whilst getting the benefits of type-checking things such as arguments, return types, or generics - a class makes sense.
- If we’re not creating instances - we have interfaces at our disposal, and their benefit comes from not generating any source code, yet allowing us to somewhat “virtually” type-check our code.

29.How to declare a variable so that it can hold multiple values?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

**Tuples**:
It represents a heterogeneous collection of values.In other words, tuples enable storing multiple fields of different types.Tuples can also be passed as parameters to functions.

**Syntax**
```typescript
let tuple_name = [value1, value2, value3,… value n]
```
Example:
```typescript
let employee: [number, string] = [1, "Priya"]; //Create a  tuple

- TypeScript supports getters/setters as a way of intercepting accesses to a member of an object.This gives a way of having finer-grained control over how a member is accessed on each object.

    private _name: string;

    get Name() {
        return this._name;

<blockquote>

- Interfaces help to achieve Polymorphism.
- An interface is a contract to implement a shape of the data.
- Use the interface to make it clear that it is intended to be implemented and used as a contract about how the object will be used.
```typescript
interface Bird {
    size: number
    fly(): void
    sleep(): void
}
class Hummingbird implements Bird { ...}
class Bellbird implements Bird { ...}
;

32.Can u explain a bit about Enum in TypeScript?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Enums or enumerations are a TypeScipt data type that allows us to define a set of named constants.Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases.It is a collection of related values that can be numeric or string values.

**Example**
```typescript
enum Gender {  
  Male,  
  Female  
  Other  
}  
console.log(Gender.Female); // Output: 1  
//We can also access an enum value by its number value. 
console.log(Gender[1]); // Output: Female
