3. Angular workflow _or_ How does Angular work or bootstrapping your angular app? _or_ How do you load an Angular application in the webserver? 

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<blockquote>
  
- Flow: `angular.json`-> `main.ts` -> `AppModule` -> `AppModule` -> `index.html`.
- Every Angular app consists of a file named `angular.json` . This file will contain all the configurations of the app. While building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the entry point of the application.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103101208/185569359-55632ef6-971e-47d9-a7bf-96a1de37026e.png)
  
- Inside the build section, the main property of the options object defines the entry point of the application which in this case is `main.ts`.
- `main.ts` is the entry point of the angular application. 
- The `main.ts` file creates a browser environment for the application to run, and, along with this, it also calls a function called bootstrap module, which bootstraps the application. These two steps are performed in the following order inside the `main.ts` file:
	
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103101208/185569651-35a2ba9f-73fc-43c6-8548-0a24daac640b.png)
- In the above line of code, `AppModule` is getting bootstrapped.
- The `AppModule` is declared in the `app.module.ts` file. This module contains declarations of all the components.
- Below is an example of the `app.module.ts` file:
	
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103101208/185569778-9ff0d34a-b0e2-4701-a1db-21919ebd3ad7.png)
	
- As one can see in the above file, `AppComponent` is getting bootstrapped.
- This component is defined in the `app.component.ts` file. This file interacts with the webpage and serves data to it.
- Below is an example of the `app.component.ts` file:
  
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103101208/185569886-8ca076a7-6633-4d61-beb5-0d673014b347.png)

- After this, Angular calls the `index.html` file. This file consequently calls the root component that is `app-root`. 
- This is how the `index.html` file looks:
	
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103101208/185569990-6c67e5b0-d9a6-4340-b2f0-dcd9a9f738c5.png)
	
- The HTML template of the root component is displayed inside the `<app-root>` tags.
- This is how every angular application works. Or This is how angular applications get bootstrapped

- In traditional web technology, the client requests for a web page (HTML/JSP) and the server sends the resource (or HTML page), and the client again requests for another page and the server responds with another resource. 
- The problem here is a lot of time is consumed in the requesting/responding or due to a lot of reloading. 
- Whereas, in the SPA technology, we maintain only one page (`index.html`) even though the URL keeps on changing.

<details>
<summary><b>Explanation</b></summary>
<blockquote>
	
Use traditional web applications or MPA when:
- Your application's client-side requirements are simple or even read-only.
- Your application needs to function in browsers without JavaScript support.

Use a SPA when:

- Your application must expose a rich user interface with many features.
- Your team is familiar with JavaScript, or TypeScript.
- Your application must already expose an API for other (internal or public) clients.

Both SPA and MPA are not flawless as they have their pros and cons. SPA is the best choice if you care about **speed and code reusability** that can be applied to develop a **mobile app**. However, it has deficiencies in SEO optimization. MPAs win in case you strive to be **ranked higher in Google**, and it is more scalable but much slower than single-page applications.

Choosing the best option, you should always have your business goals and requirements in mind.

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

- In our web application, we use many javascript files that are added to the HTML pages via `<script>` tags.  For each user request, the browser loads these bunch of script files inside the HTML page. This is inefficient as it reduces the page speed since the browser requests each script file separately.
- This can be solved by **bundling** several files together into one file to be downloaded by the browser in one single request.
- **Module bundlers** are used to bundle a group of JavaScript modules with their dependencies and merge them into a single file in the correct order, which can be executed by the browser.
- **Webpack** is a powerful static module bundler for JavaScript applications that packages all modules in our application into a bundle and serves it to the browser. Webpack builds a dependency graph when it processes the application.

<blockquote>

- Any time one file depends on another, webpack treats this as a dependency. This allows webpack to take images or web fonts, and also provide them as dependencies for your application.

- When webpack processes your application, it starts from a list of modules defined on the command line or in its configuration file. Starting from these entry points, webpack recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs, then bundles all of those modules into a small number of bundles - often, only one - to be loaded by the browser.

Yes, I recommend the AOT compiler. Here are my reasons:

- **Faster rendering**: With AOT, the browser downloads a pre-compiled version of the application. The browser loads executable code so it can render the application immediately, without waiting to compile the application first.
- **Detect template errors earlier**: The AOT compiler detects and reports template binding errors during the build step before users can see them.
- **Better Security**: AOT compiles HTML templates and components into JavaScript files long before they are served to the client. With no templates to read and no risky client-side HTML or JavaScript evaluation, there are fewer opportunities for injection attacks.

| JIT downloads the compiler and compiles code exactly before Displaying it in the browser.         | AOT has already complied with the code while building your application, so it doesn’t have to compile at runtime. |
| Loading in JIT is slower than the AOT because it needs to compile your application at runtime. | Loading in AOT is much quicker than the JIT because it already has compiled your code at build time.              |
| JIT is more suitable for development mode.                                                     | AOT is much more suitable in the case of Production mode.                                                              |
| Bundle size is higher compared to AOT.                                                          | Bundle size optimized in AOT, in results AOT bundle size is half the size of JIT bundles.                         |
| You can run your app in JIT with this command: `ng build` OR `ng serve`                            | To run your app in AOT you have to provide –aot at the end like: `ng build --at OR `ng serve --not                 |
| You can catch template binding errors at display time.                                          | You can catch the template error at building your application.                                                    |

<blockquote>
  
- Angular is a typescript-based web application framework used to create & build web apps
- It allows us to create Single Page Applications (SPA)
- Angular written using TypeScript
- Angular uses Databinding and Routing
- Angular uses Jasmine testing framework

**NOTE** - The candidate must come up with the angular points that they see in the application. Depends on the candidate. This makes the interviewer understand how far the candidate can relate a real-time application to the topic
