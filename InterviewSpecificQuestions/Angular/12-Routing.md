1.Run the `ng new routing-app --routing ` command to generate a basic Angular app with an app routing module, where we can configure our routes.
2.To use the Angular router, an app needs to have at least two components so that it can navigate from one to the other.Run these commands `ng g c login` and `ng g c register` to generate 2 components - *LoginComponent* and RegisterComponent*.
3.In the app routing module, the CLI creates a Routes array used to define our routes.There we can path `/login`  and  `/register`
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'login', component: LoginComponent },
  { path: 'register', component: RegisterComponent },
];
```

<blockquote>

* `<router-outlet>` - works as a placeholder to load the different components dynamically based on the activated component.

*  *routerLink* - is an attribute to an anchor tag that sets the route for the component.

5.Where do you define the routes in the Angular application?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

In the `app.routing.ts` file, you can add the paths and components under the `routes` array.
```ts
 const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'first-component', component: FirstComponent },
  { path: 'second-component', component: SecondComponent },
];
```

6.List some of the interfaces used in routing guards?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

* `CanActivate` - decides if the route can be activated.
* `CanActivateChild`- decides if children of a route can be activated.
* `CanLoad`- decides if a route can be loaded.
* `CanDeactivate`- decides if the user can leave a route.

7.How do you create a routing guard?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>

<blockquote>

Run the `ng g guard <guard-name>` command in your terminal to generate a guard service.When we run the `ng g guard admin` command, the CLI creates a service class that implements any one of the guard interfaces.

*admin.guard.ts:*
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot } from '@angular/router';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

import { AuthService } from './auth/auth.service';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AdminGuard implements CanActivate {

  constructor(private authService: AuthService){}

  canActivate(
    next: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
    state: RouterStateSnapshot): Observable<boolean> | Promise<boolean> | boolean {
      return this.authService.isLoggedIn;
  }
}
```
* Adminguard is a class that implements the *CanActivate* interface and overrides the `canActivate()` method.The canActivate() method uses the following parameters:
    * `next: ActivatedRouteSnapshot` - Contains the information about a route associated with a component loaded in an outlet at a particular moment in time.
    * `state: RouterStateSnapshot` - Contains the information about the router state at a particular moment in time.

* In this example, the `canActivate()` method to only allow access if the user is logged in.
Here imported the *AuthService* to get the value of the `isLoggedIn` property which holds `true` if the user logged in else `false`.

* We apply the guard to the routes, by imposing the `canActivate` property of the path object.
*admin-routing.module.ts* 
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
    {
        path: 'admin',
        component: ProjectComponent,
        children: [
            {
                path: 'list',
                component: EmployeeListComponent,
                canActivate: [AdminGuard]
            },            
            {
                path: 'create',
                component: EmployeeListComponent,
                canActivate: [AdminGuard]
            }
        ]
    }
```
* Here, we can access the *EmployeeListComponent* and *EmployeeListComponent* only if we had logged in.

9.What is the use of `RoutingModule` in Angular?


![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Angular provides a `RouterModule` that has the necessary service providers and directives for navigating through application views.The router defines the navigation of views on a single page and interprets URL links to determine which views to create or destroy, and which components to load or unload.
