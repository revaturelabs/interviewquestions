<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Reflection is the process of describing the metadata of types, methods, and fields in a code.The namespace System.
- Reflection enables us to obtain data about the loaded assemblies, and the elements within them like classes, methods, and value types.

2.What is the difference between dispose and finalize methods in C#?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

`dispose()` must be explicitly invoked by the user and the `finalize()` is called by the garbage collector when the object is destroyed.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

Tuples are data structures that hold object properties and contain a sequence of elements of different data types.They were introduced as a `Tuple<T>` class in .NET Framework to avoid the need of creating separate types to hold object properties.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

A thread in C# can have any of the following states:

Aborted – The thread is dead but has not stopped
Running – The thread is executing
Stopped – The thread has stopped the execution
Suspended – The thread has been suspended
Unstarted – The thread is created but has not started execution yet
WaitSleepJoin – The thread calls sleep, calls wait on another object, and calls join on some other thread

6.What do you understand by regular expressions in C#? Can you write a program that searches a string using regular expressions?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

A regular expression is a template for matching a set of inputs.It can consist of constructs, character literals, and operators.Regex is used for string parsing, as well as replacing the character string.

The following code searches a string “C#” against the set of inputs from the languages array using Regex:

```C#

static void Main(strong[] args)
{
string[] languages = {“C#”, “Python”, “Java”};
foreach(string s in languages)
{
if(System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch(s,“C#”))
{
Console.WriteLine(“Match found”);
}
}
}

```

7.What are Indexers in C#?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

C# introduces a new concept known as Indexers which are used for treating an object as an array.The indexers are usually known as smart arrays in C#.They are not an essential part of object-oriented programming.

Defining an indexer allows us to create classes that act as virtual arrays.Instances of that class can be accessed using the [] array access operator.

8.What is Serialization?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

Serialization converts a code to its binary format using a process.After it is converted to bytes, it can be easily stored and written to a disk.Serializations are useful so that the original form of the code isn’t lost and can be retrieved later.

9.Can you explain about delegates?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- A Delegate is a variable that holds the reference to a method.Hence it is a function pointer or reference type.All Delegates are derived from System.Delegate namespace.Both Delegate and the method that it refers to can have the same signature.

- **Declaring a delegate**: `public delegate void AddNumbers(int n);`
After the declaration of a delegate, the object must be created by the delegate using the new keyword.

  - `AddNumbers an1 = new AddNumbers(number);

- The delegate provides a kind of encapsulation to the reference method, which will internally get called when a delegate is called.

```C#

public delegate int myDel(int number);
public class Program
{
    public int AddNumbers(int a)
    {
        int Sum = a + 10;
        return Sum;
    }
    public void Start()
    {
        myDel DelegateExample = AddNumbers;
    }
}

```

10.What are Events?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- Events are user actions that generate notifications to the application to which it must respond.The user actions can be mouse movements, keypress and so on.

- Programmatically, a class that raises an event is called a publisher and a class which responds/receives the event is called a subscriber.The event should have at least one subscriber else that event is never raised.

- Delegates are used to declare Events.

``` C#
Public delegate void PrintNumbers();
Event PrintNumbers myEvent;
```

<blockquote> 

- A Delegate that points to more than one method is called a Multicast Delegate.Multicasting is achieved by using the + and += operator.

<blockquote> 

- Delegates are used to raise events and handle them.Always a delegate needs to be declared first and then the Events are declared.

13.Can you state the difference between direct cast and ctype?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

The difference between direct cast and ctype is that direct cast is used for the conversion of the type of an object that requires a run time which is like the specified type in the direct cast.Whereas ctype is used for converting the conversion which is defined for the expression and the type.

LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query.LINQ has the great power of querying any source of data.The data source could be collections of objects, databases, or XML files.We can easily retrieve data from any object that implements the `IEnumerable<T>` interface.

15.Can you explain the “using” statement?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

The keyword “using” is used to define the scope of the resources used in that using statement block.All the resources used inside the using code block get disposed of once the code block completes execution.

```C#

class Books : IDisposable
    	{
        private string _name { get; set; }
        private decimal _price { get; set; }

        public Books(string name, decimal price)
        {
            _name = name;
            _price = price;
        }

        public void Print()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Book name is {0} and price is {1}", _name, _price);
        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }
   	}

    	class Students
    	{
        public void DoSomething()
        {
            using (Books myBook = new Books("book name", 12.45))
            {
                myBook.Print();
            }

16.In C# private constructor or sealed class, which one would you prefer to prevent a class extension in inheritance and why?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

The best choice is to use a sealed class to prevent the class not to be extended/inherited.This is true that a private constructor and sealed class both can prevent the extension of a class, which means, we cannot derive any class from it.However, they have their own purpose and properties.
