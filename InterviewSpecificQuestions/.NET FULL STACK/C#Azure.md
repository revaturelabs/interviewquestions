**Managed Instance**: This model is targeted for migration activities from On-premises to the cloud environment.
Elastic pool: This model helps to reduce costs by sharing the same resources with a group of standalone databases.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

Backup is important to handle the issues of hardware and 3 database replicas are used in SQL Azure for backup. For the errors based on the user level, the COPY command is used for the creation of the SQL Azure database replica. It is also possible to back up the data of SQL Azure to any local SQL server with the use of SSIS, BCP etc.

17. How can you improve the performance of SQL Azure databases?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

To improve the performance of SQL Azure databases, you can tune the database by using the information from the execution plan as well as statistics of the query. It is possible to use dynamic management views of SQL Azure for the monitoring and management of the SQL Azure database. Network latency and bandwidth also affect the performance of the SQL Azure database so it can be used to improve the performance.

18. How is SQL Azure different from SQL server?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

SQL Azure is a cloud-based service and so it has its own set of pros and cons when compared to SQL servers. SQL Azure service benefits include on-demand provisioning, high availability, reduced management overhead and scalability. But SQL Azure abstracts some details from the subscriber which can be good or bad which depends on the context of the need.

19. How many replicas are maintained for each SQL Azure database?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

For each database, three replicas are maintained for each database that one provisions. One of them is a primary replica. All read/write happens on the primary replica and other replicas are kept in sync with the primary replica. If for some reason, the primary goes down, another replica is promoted to primary. All this happens under the hood.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

As of now, we have to build a custom solution at the application level that can handle the scale out of underlying SQL Azure databases. But Microsoft has announced, SQL Azure Federations that will assist in scaling out of SQL Azure databases. And scale-out means that we are splitting the data into smaller subsets spread across multiple databases.

24.  What is Federation?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- The federation is where you define the data type (e.g., Customer ID, Product ID) you’ll share. 
- As with creating the root database, you can create a federation through the SQL Azure database management portal, with SQLAzureMW or by using this T-SQL script while connected to your root database:

```SQL
CREATE FEDERATION <FederationName>(<DistributionKeyName> <DistributionType> RANGE)
```
In this example, 

- `<FederationName>` is the name of the federation (not the name of the physical database, which is a System-GUID). 
- `<DistributionKeyName>` is the name for the distribution key, 
- `<DistributionType>` is the distribution data type that data will be sharded on. 
- The valid distribution data types are int, bigint, uniqueidentifier and varbinary (up to 900).
