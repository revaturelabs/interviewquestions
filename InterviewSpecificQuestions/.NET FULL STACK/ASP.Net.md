<blockquote>

- It is certainly possible to do that with the help of the process of new precompilation which is also known as ‘precompilation for deployment’. 
- We can make use of aspnet_compiler.exe to make sure that the precompilation of the site is done. Besides, the process also builds every page in the web application in a single one with DLL and other placeholder files.

- When ASP.NET pages run, it goes through several steps of the life cycle, which perform a series of actions like initialization, running, restoring, and rendering.

- Life Cycle is classified into two categories.

**Application Life Cycle**: The user requests for accessing the application.
**Page Life Cycle**: Page Life Cycle has phases like initialization, restoring, execution, and page rendering.

The web.config file is crucial because it contains the configuration settings for the application. It keeps your entire configuration separate from your code so you can easily change settings without code changes. It also allows you to potentially encrypt the configuration settings for increased security.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Request flow handles the request from the clients and passes it to the server. The request hits the controller coming from the client. 
- Controller plays its role and decides which model to use to serve the request further, passing that model to view which then transforms the model and generates an appropriate response that is rendered to the client.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

To make sure that the state between the postbacks is well maintained, ASP.NET offers a mechanism which is called view state. There are hidden form fields which are used for storing the objects stored on the client section and are returned to the server as soon as the postback occurs.

12. Can you differentiate Server.Transfer and Response.Redirect?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- In `Server.Transfer` page processing transfers from one page to the other page without making a round-trip back to the client’s browser. This provides a faster response with a little less overhead on the server. The client URL history list or current URL Server does not update in case of `Server.Transfer`.

- `Response.Redirect` is used to redirect the user’s browser to another page or site. It performs a trip back to the client where the client’s browser is redirected to the new page. The user’s browser history list is updated to reflect the new address.

25. What is the difference between a session and an application object?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- The difference between session and application object is that all users share one Application object and with sessions, there is one session object for each user. Data stored in the application object can be shared by all the sessions of the application. Application object stores data in the key-value pair.
- Session object stores session-specific information and the information is visible within the session only. ASP.NET creates a unique SessionId for each session of the application. 
- SessionIDs are maintained either by an HTTP cookie or a modified URL, as set in the applications configuration settings. By default, SessionID values are stored in cookies.
