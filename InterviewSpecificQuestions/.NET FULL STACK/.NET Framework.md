2. How does the .NET framework work?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- .NET framework-based applications are compiled to Common Intermediate Language (CIL).
- Compiled code is stored in the form of an assembly file that has a .dll or .exe file extension.
- When the .NET application runs, Common Language Runtime (CLR) takes the assembly file and converts the CIL into machine code with the help of the Just In Time(JIT) compiler.
- Finally, the converted machine code can execute on the specific architecture of the computer it is running on.

3. What is an EXE?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- EXE is an executable file that runs the application for which it is designed. 
- An EXE is produced when we build an application. 
- That's why the assemblies are loaded directly when we run an EXE. But an EXE cannot be shared with the other applications.

8. Can you differentiate Value type and Reference type?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- A value type holds a data value within its own memory space. A reference type holds a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.
- In value type, the value is copied to the new location, so there are two identical copies of the same value in the memory. In reference type, the reference is copied while the actual value remains the same.
- A value type is stored in the stack. A reference type is stored on the heap.

**Examples**: The int, float, double, struct, enum are some examples of value types. The class, array, interface are some examples of reference types.

<blockquote> 

- Assemblies are the building blocks of .NET Framework applications,  they form the fundamental unit of deployment, version control, reuse, activation scoping, and security permissions.

10. Can you explain the different types of assemblies in .NET framework?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

**Static Assemblies** can include .NET types (interfaces and classes), as well as required resources for the assembly (bitmaps, JPEG files, resource files, and so on). Static assemblies are stored on disk in PE files.
**Dynamic Assemblies** are one which run directly from memory and are not saved to disk before execution. They can be saved to disk after they have executed.

11. What are the types of memories supported in the .NET framework?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

Two types of memories are present in .NET. They are:
- **Stack**: Stack is a stored-value type that keeps track of each executing thread and its location. It is used for static memory allocation.

- **Heap**: Heap is a stored reference type that keeps track of the more precise objects or data. It is used for dynamic memory allocation.

12. What is a delegate in .NET?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- A delegate is a .NET object which defines a method signature and it can pass a function as a parameter.
- Delegate always points to a method that matches its specific signature. Users can encapsulate the reference of a method in a delegate object.
- When we pass the delegate object in a program, it will call the referenced method. To create a custom event in a class, we can make use of delegate.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

Constant fields are created using the const keyword and their value remains the same throughout the program. The Read-only fields are created using a read-only keyword and their value can be changed. Const is a compile-time constant while Read-only is a runtime constant.

19. What are Managed and Unmanaged codes?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

Managed code runs inside CLR and installing the .NET Framework is necessary to execute it. Unmanaged code does not depend on CLR for execution and is developed using languages outside the .NET framework.

20. How is a Managed code executed?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

The steps for executing a managed code are as follows:

- Choose a language compiler depending on the language of the code.
- Convert the code into Intermediate language using its own compiler.
- The IL is then targeted to CLR which converts the code into native code using JIT.
- Execution of Native code.

22. When an assembly is said to be strongly named in .NET Framework?

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

An assembly is said to be strongly named assembly when it has the following properties

- The assembly name.
- Version number.
- The assembly should have been signed with the private/public key pair.

23. What is the difference between Strong and Weak Assemblies in .NET Framework?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- If an assembly is not signed with the private/public key pair then the assembly is said to be a weak named assembly and it is not guaranteed to be unique and may cause the DLL hell problem. 
- The Strong named assemblies are guaranteed to be unique and solve the DLL hell problem. Again, we cannot install an assembly into GAC unless the assembly is strongly named.

24. What is Reflection in C#?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

Reflection is needed when we want to determine or inspect the content of an assembly. Here, content means the metadata of an assembly like what are the methods in that assembly, what are the properties in that assembly, are they public, are they private, etc.

For example, one of the biggest implementations of Reflection is Visual Studio itself. Suppose, in visual studio, we create an object of the String class, and when we press obj. then visual studio intelligence showing all the properties, methods, fields, etc of that object. And this is possible because of Reflection in C#.

25. What are the real-time uses of Reflection in C#?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/InterviewSpecificQuestions/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- If we are creating applications like Visual Studio Editors where you want to show internal details 
i.e.. Metadata of an object using Intelligence.
- In unit testing sometimes, we need to invoke private methods to test whether the private members are working properly or not.
- Sometimes we would like to dump properties, methods, and assembly references to a file or probably show it on a screen.
- Late binding can also be achieved by using Reflection in C#. We can use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, about which we don’t have any information at compile time. So, Reflection enables us to use code that is not available at compile time.
- Consider an example where we have two alternate implementations of an interface. We want to allow the user to pick one or the other using a config file. With reflection, we can simply read the name of the class whose implementation we want to use from the config file and instantiate an instance of that class. This is another example of late binding using reflection.
