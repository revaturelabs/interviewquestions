4.What is O-R (Object relational) impedance mismatch? What problems may occur due to the impedance mismatch? 

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- Impedance mismatch is the term used to refer to the problems that occurs due to differences between the database model and the programming language model.
- The practical relational model has 3 components these are:
  - Attributes and their data types
  - Tuples
  - Tables
- Following problems may occur due to the impedance mismatch:
  - The first problem that may occur is that is data type mismatch means the programming language attribute data type may differ from the attribute data type in the data model.Hence it is quite necessary to have a binding for each host programming language that specifies for each attribute type the compatible programming language types.It is necessary to have different data types, for example, we have different data types available in different programming languages such as data types in C are different from Java and both differ from SQL data types.
  - The second problem that may occur is because the results of most queries are sets or multisets of tuples and each tuple is formed of a sequence of attribute values.In the program, it is necessary to access the individual data values within individual tuples for printing or processing.Hence, there is a need for binding to map the query result data structure which is a table to an appropriate data structure in the programming language.A mechanism is needed to loop over the tuples in a query result in order to access a single tuple at a time and to extract individual values from the tuple.The extracted values are typically copied to appropriate program variables for further processing by the program.A cursor or iterator is a variable which is used for looping over the tuples in a query result.Individual values within each 	tuple are extracted into different or unique program variables of the appropriate datatype.
  - Impedance mismatch is less of a problem when a special database programming language is designed that uses the same data model and data type as a database model for example Oracle’s/SQL.

6.	What is lazy initialization in the Java Persistence?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- Lazy Loading is a design pattern that we use to defer initialization of an object as long as it's possible.
- Let's see how this works.
- First, we'll look at the UserLazy class:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "USER")
public class UserLazy implements Serializable {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    @Column(name = "USER_ID")
    private Long userId;

    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy = "user")
    private Set<OrderDetail> orderDetail = new HashSet();

    // standard setters and getters
    // also override equals and hashcode
}
```
- Next, we'll see the OrderDetail class:

```java
@Entity
@Table (name = "USER_ORDER")
public class OrderDetail implements Serializable {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    @Column(name="ORDER_ID")
    private Long orderId;
    
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name="USER_ID")
    private UserLazy user;

    // standard setters and getters
    // also override equals and hashcode
}
```
- One User can have multiple OrderDetails.In eager loading strategy, if we load the User data, it will also load up all orders associated with it and will store it in a memory.
- But when we enable lazy loading, if we pull up a UserLazy, OrderDetail data won't be initialized and loaded into a memory until we make an explicit call to it.

<blockquote>

- Assume the scenario that you are using one database called mysql in your application then following is the way to create the SessionFactory object :

```java
Configuration cfg=new Configuration(); // Empty object will be created.
cfg=cfg.configure();
```

- Here when you called configure() method It looks for hibernate-cfg.xml and for Hibernate mapping file filled with all the properties defined in the configuration documents and mapping documents.

SessionFactory sc=cfg.buildSessionFactory();
• SessionFactory object will be created once and will be used by multiple users for long time. Because it is a thread safe class.
• Session Factory object is the factory for session objects.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- The class must not be declared final.No methods or persistent instance variables must be declared final.
- JPA implementations use proxies in front of your entities to manage for example: Lazy loading.As a final class cannot be extended, a proxy cannot be built.
- The class must have a public or protected, no-argument constructor.
- These kind of frameworks and others in order to create new objects use that is the reason why a no arg constructor is needed.

```java
Class.newInstance()
``` 

- Persistent instance variables must be declared private, protected, or package-private.
Being only accesible through accessor or business methods allow interception in proxies.

28.	What is field based access and property-based access of table fields?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- Access strategies
    As a JPA provider, hibernate can introspect both the entity attributes (instance fields) or the accessors (instance properties).By default, the placement of the @Id annotation gives the default access strategy.When placed on a field, Hibernate will assume field-based access.Place on the identifier getter, Hibernate will use property-based access.

- Field-based access
Example 1.Field-based access
```java
@Entitypublic class Simple {

    @Id
    private Integer id;

    public Integer getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId( Integer id ) {
        this.id = id;
    }}
```

- When using field-based access, adding other entity-level methods is much more flexible because Hibernate won’t consider those part of the persistence state.To exclude a field from being part of the entity persistent state, the field must be marked with the @Transient annotation.

- Another advantage of using field-based access is that some entity attributes can be hidden from outside the entity.An example of such attribute is the entity @Version field, which must not be manipulated by the data access layer.With field-based access, we can simply omit the getter and the setter for this version field and hibernate can still leverage the optimistic concurrency control mechanism.

Property-based access

Example 2.Property-based access

```java
@Entitypublic class Simple {

    private Integer id;

    @Id
    public Integer getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId( Integer id ) {
        this.id = id;
    }}
```
When using property-based access, Hibernate uses the accessors for both reading and writing the entity state.Every other method that will be added to the entity (e.g.helper methods for synchronizing both ends of a bidirectional one-to-many association) will have to be marked with the @Transient annotation.

- HQL is similar to SQL and is also case insensitive.
- HQL and SQL both fire queries in a database.In the case of HQL, the queries are in
the form of objects that are translated to SQL queries in the target database.
- SQL works with tables and columns to manipulate the data stored in it.
- HQL works with classes and their properties to finally be mapped to a table structure
in a database.
- HQL supports concepts like polymorphism, inheritance, association, etc.It is a
powerful and easy-to-learn language that makes SQL object oriented.
- SQL lets you modify the data through insert, update, and delete queries.You can add
tables, procedures, or views to your database.The permissions on these added objects
can be changed.

34.	What is transaction and how it is achieved in hibernate?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- A transaction simply represents a unit of work.In such case, if one step fails, the whole transaction fails (which is termed as atomicity).		A transaction can be described by ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability).

- Transaction Interface in Hibernate:
    In hibernate framework, we have Transaction interface that defines the unit of work.It maintains abstraction from the transaction implementation (JTA,JDBC).

    A transaction is associated with Session and instantiated by calling session.beginTransaction().

    The methods of Transaction interface are as follows:

    1.	void begin() starts a new transaction.
    2.	void commit() ends the unit of work unless we are in FlushMode.NEVER.
    3.	void rollback() forces this transaction to rollback.
    4.	void setTimeout(int seconds) it sets a transaction timeout for any transaction started by a subsequent call to begin on this instance.
    5.	boolean isAlive() checks if the transaction is still alive.
    6.	void registerSynchronization(Synchronization s) registers a user synchronization callback for this transaction.
    7.	boolean was Committed() checks if the transaction is committed successfully.
    8.	boolean was RolledBack() checks if the transaction is rolledback successfully.

- Example of Transaction Management in Hibernate:

    In hibernate, it is better to roll back the transaction if any exception occurs, so that resources can be free.Let's see the example of transaction management in hibernate.

```java
    	Session session = null;  
    	Transaction tx = null;  
    	try {  
    	session = sessionFactory.openSession();  
    	tx = session.beginTransaction();  
    	//some action	  
    	tx.commit();  
    	}catch (Exception ex) {  
    	ex.printStackTrace();  
    	tx.rollback();  
    	}  
    	finally {session.close();}  
```
