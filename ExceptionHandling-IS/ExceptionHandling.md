1.How can you throw an exception object?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
  
The exception object contains a lot of debugging information such as method hierarchy, line number where the exception occurred, type of exception, etc. When the exception occurs in a method, the process of creating the exception object and handing it over to the runtime environment is called "throwing an  exception".Once runtime receives the exception object, it tries to find the handler for the exception. Exception Handler is the block of code that can process the exception object.

<blockquote>
  
An object representing that exception is created and thrown in the method that caused the error. That method may choose to handle the exception itself, or pass it on. Either way, at some point, the exception is caught and processed. Exceptions can be generated by the Java run-time system, or they can be manually generated by your code.

4.How exception handling manages try,catch,throw,throws and finally statements?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

Program statements that you want to monitor for exceptions are contained within a try block. If an exception occurs within the try block, it is thrown. The code can catch this exception using catch and handle it in some manner.System-generated exceptions are automatically thrown by the Java run-time system. To manually throw an exception, use the keyword throw. Any exception that is thrown out of a method must be specified as such by a throws clause. Any code that absolutely must be executed after a try block completes is put in a finally block.

8.What happens when you don’t handle exceptions in your program.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

When the Java run-time system detects a runtime-error, it constructs a new exception object and then throws the exception because once an exception has been thrown, it must be caught by an exception handler and dealt with immediately. If we didn't supplied any exception handlers of our own, the exception is caught by the default handler provided by the Java run-time system. Any exception that is not caught by your program will ultimately be processed bythe default handler. The default handler describes the exception and prints a stack trace from the point at which the exception occurred, and terminates the program.

11.Explain the role of Throwable class in Exception handling?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

All exception types are subclasses of the built-in class Throwable. Thus, Throwable is at the top of the exception class hierarchy. Immediately below Throwable are two subclasses that partition exceptions into two distinct branches. One branch is headed by Exception. This class is used for exceptional conditions that user programs should catch. This is also the class that you will subclass to create your own custom exception types. There is an important subclass of Exception, called RuntimeException. Exceptions of this type are automatically defined for the programs that you write and include things such as division by zero and invalid array indexing.The other branch is topped by Error, which defines exceptions that are not expected to be caught under normal circumstances by your program. Exceptions of type Error are used by the Java run-time system to indicate errors having to do with the run-time environment,itself. Stack overflow is an example of such an error.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

The try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources. The resource is as an object that must be closed after finishing the program. The try-with-resources statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement execution.You can pass any object that implements java.lang.AutoCloseable, which includes all objects which implement java.io.Closeable.The following example writes a string into a file. It uses an instance of FileOutputStream to write data into the file. FileOutputStream is a resource that must be closed after the program is finished with it. So, in this example, closing of resource is done by itself try.

```java 

import java.io.*;    

public class TryWithResources {    

public static void main(String args[]){    
  
try(FileOutputStream fileOutputStream =newFileOutputStream("/Textfiles/abc.txt")){    
  
String msg = "REVATURE!";      

byte byteArray[] = msg.getBytes(); 

fileOutputStream.write(byteArray);  

System.out.println("Message written to file successfuly!");  
    
}catch(Exception exception){

17.Can we throw an exception explicitly or manually?explain with an example?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

we can throw a user defined exception or, a predefined exception explicitly using the throw keyword.There are two types of exceptions user defined and predefined each exception is represented by a class and which inherits the Throwable class.To throw an exception explicitly you need to instantiate the class of it and throw its object using the throw keyword.

```java

public class ExceptionExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello");
      NullPointerException nullPointer = new NullPointerException();
      throw nullPointer;
   }
}
Output
Hello
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
   at MyPackage.ExceptionExample.main(ExceptionExample.java:6)

```

Whenever you throw an exception explicitly you need to make sure that the line with throw keyword is the last line of the program. This is because any code written after it is unreachable code and if you still have code snippets below this line a compile time error will be generated.

```java

Example
public class ExceptionExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello");
      NullPointerException nullPointer = new NullPointerException();
      throw nullPointer;
      System.out.println("How are you");
   }
}
Compile time error

<blockquote>

The OutofMemoryError  is thrown when there is insufficient space to allocate an object in the Java heap. In this case, the garbage collector cannot make space available to accommodate a new object, and the heap cannot be expanded further. Also, this error may be thrown when there is insufficient native memory to support the loading of a Java class. In a rare instance, a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` may be thrown when an excessive amount of time is being spent doing garbage collection and little memory is being freed.

Yes, we can have an empty catch block.

24.How rethrowing is done in exception handling?Explain with an example?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

If a catch block cannot handle the particular exception it has caught, we can rethrow the exception. The rethrow expression causes the originally thrown object to be rethrown.Because the exception has already been caught at the scope in which the rethrow expression occurs, it is rethrown out to the next enclosing try block. Therefore, it cannot be handled by catch blocks at the scope in which the rethrow expression occurred. Any catch blocks for the enclosing try block have an opportunity to catch the exception.

```java

public class RethrowException {
   public static void test1() throws Exception {
      System.out.println("The Exception in test1() method");
      throw new Exception("thrown from test1() method");
   }
   public static void test2() throws Throwable {
      try {
         test1();
      } catch(Exception e) {
         System.out.println("Inside test2() method");
         throw e;
      }
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {
      try {
         test2();
      } catch(Exception e) {
         System.out.println("Caught in main");
      }

<blockquote>

The chained exception feature allows you to associate another exception with an exception. This second exception describes the cause of the first exception. For example,imagine a situation in which a method throws an ArithmeticException because of an attempt to divide by zero. However, the actual cause of the problem was that an I/O error occurred,which caused the divisor to be set improperly. Although the method must certainly throw an ArithmeticException, since that is the error that occurred, you might also want to let the calling code know that the underlying cause was an I/O error.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

throw :
throw is a keyword in java which is used to throw an exception manually. Using throw keyword, you can throw an exception from any method or block. But, that exception must be of type `java.lang.Throwable` class or it’s sub classes. 

```java

class ThrowExample
{
    void method() throws Exception
    {
        Exception e = new Exception();
 
        throw e;            //throwing an exception using 'throw'
    }
}

```

throws:
throws is also a keyword in java which is used in the method signature to indicate that this method may throw mentioned exceptions. The caller to such methods must handle the mentioned exceptions either using try-catch blocks or using throws keyword. 

```java

return_type method_name(parameter_list) throws exception_list
{
     //some statements
}

class ThrowsExample
{
    void methodOne() throws SQLException
    {
        //This method may throw SQLException
    }
 
    void methodTwo() throws IOException
    {
        //This method may throw IOException
    }
 
    void methodThree() throws ClassNotFoundException
    {
        //This method may throw ClassNotFoundException
    }
}

```

Throwable In Java :
Throwable is a super class for all types of errors and exceptions in java. This class is a member of java.lang package. Only instances of this class or it’s sub classes are thrown by the java virtual machine or by the throw statement. The only argument of catch block must be of this type or it’s sub classes. If you want to create your own customized exceptions, then your class must extend this class. 

```java

class MyException extends Throwable
{
           //Customized Exception class
}
 
class ThrowableExample
{
    void method() throws MyException
    {
        MyException e = new MyException();
 
        throw e;

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

If it is possible for a method to throw an exception if it could not be handled, it should specify that exception using the 'throws' keyword. It will be helpful to the caller functions of that method in handling that exception. The syntax for using the 'throws' keyword is,

```java

return_type method_name(parameter_list) throws exception_list{

     //code

}

```
Here, exception_list is the list of exceptions which may be thrown by the method. These exceptions should be separated by commas. An example of the code : 

```java

public class ExceptionHandling{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        try{
            methodWithThrows();
        }

<blockquote>

The above program won’t compile and you will get an error message as “The exception FileNotFoundException is already caught by the alternative IOException. This is because FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException, there are two ways to solve this problem. 
The first way is to use a single catch block for both the exceptions.

```java

		try {
			test();
		}catch(FileNotFoundException e){
			e.printStackTrace();
		}catch (IOException  e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}

Another way is to remove the FileNotFoundException from the multi-catch block.

```java

		try {
			test();
		}catch (IOException  e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}

This code will throw compiler error on line where RuntimeException  variable “re” is written on catch block. since Exception is super class of RuntimeException, all RuntimeException thrown by start() method will be captured by first catch block and code will never reach second catch block and that's the reason compiler will flag error as "exception `java.lang.RuntimeException` has already been caught".

In this code compiler will complain on sub class where start() method gets overridden. As per rules of method overriding in Java, an overridden method can not throw Checked Exception which is higher in hierarchy than original method. Since here start() is throwing IOException in super class, start() in sub class can only throw either IOException or any sub class of IOException but not super class of IOException for ex: Exception.

The compiler will complain about the line where we are handling IOException, since IOException is a checked Exception and start() method doesn't throw IOException, so the compiler will flag error as "exception `java.io.IOException` is never thrown in body of corresponding try statement", but if you change IOException to Exception compiler error will disappear because Exception can be used to catch all RuntimeException which doesn't require a declaration in a throws clause.

The programmer wants to create his own customized exception as per the requirements of the application which is called user-defined exception or custom exception.

Custom exceptions in Java are those exceptions that are created by a programmer to meet the specific requirements of the application. That’s why it is also known as user-defined exception in Java.

For example:

1. A banking application, a customer whose age is lower than 18 years, the program throws a custom exception indicating “needs to open joint account”.

2. Voting age in India: If a person’s age entered is less than 18 years, the program throws "invalid age" as a custom exception.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>
These are the following steps that are followed in creating user-defined exception or custom exception in Java. They are as follows:

Step 1: User-defined exceptions can be created simply by extending Exception class. This is done as:

class OwnException extends Exception
Step 2: If you do not want to store any exception details, define a default constructor in your own exception class. This can be done as follows:

```java

OwnException()
{

 }

```
Step 3: If you want to store exception details, define a parameterized constructor with string as a parameter, call superclass (Exception) constructor from this, and store variable “str”. This can be done as follows:

```java

OwnException(String str)
{
  super(str); // Call super class exception constructor and store variable "str" in it.
}

```
Step 4: In the last step, we need to create an object of user-defined exception class and throw it using throw clause.

```java

OwnException obj = new OwnException("Exception details");
  throw obj;
(or)
 throw new OwnException("Exception details");

```

<blockquote>

Exception and all of its subclasses don’t provide any specific methods and all of the methods are defined in the base class Throwable.

`String getMessage()` - This method returns the message String of Throwable and the message can be provided while creating the exception through its constructor.

`String getLocalizedMessage()` - This method is provided so that subclasses can override it to provide the local specific messages to the calling program. Throwable class implementation of this method simply use getMessage() method to return the exception message.

`synchronized Throwable getCause()` - This method returns the cause of the exception or null if the cause is unknown.

`String toString()` - This method returns the information about Throwable in String format, the returned String contains the name of Throwable class and localized message.

`void printStackTrace()` - This method prints the stack trace information to the standard error stream, this method is overloaded and we can pass PrintStream or PrintWriter as an argument to write the stack trace information to the file or stream.

- Writing data to a disk but the disk is full or unformatted.
- When the program asks for user input and the user enters invalid data.
- When a user attempts to divide an integer value by zero, an exception occurs.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

`Throwable` class is the parent class of all exception types. It is an immediate subclass of the `Object` class. Below `Throwable` class, there are two subclasses (two child objects) `Error` and `Exception`.

`Error` class is the subclass of `Throwable` class and a superclass of all the runtime error classes. It terminates the program if there is a problem related to a system or resources (JVM).

An exception is an abnormal condition that is caused by runtime error in the program. It is the superclass of all exceptions in Java. It is further divided into checked and unchecked (runtime) exceptions.

Checked exceptions are those exceptions that are checked by Java compiler at compilation. A list of some important checked exceptions are given below:

```java
	
ClassNotFoundException
InterruptedException
InstantiationException
IOException
SQLException
IllegalAccessException
FileNotFoundException, etc

```
	
Runtime exceptions are those exceptions that are checked by JVM at runtime. Some important examples of runtime exceptions are given below:

```java
	
ArithmeticException
ClassCastException
NullPointerException
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
NegativeArraySizeException
ArrayStoreException
IllegalThreadStateException
SecurityException, etc.

72. Explain chained exceptions in Java?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

In a program, one exception can throw many exceptions by inducing a domino effect. This causes a chain of exceptions. It is beneficial to know the location of the actual cause of the exception. This is possible with the chained exceptions feature in Java. For implementation of chained exceptions in Java, two new constructors and two new methods are included in the Throwable class. These are,

Constructors Of Throwable class:

`Throwable(Throwable cause)` - The cause is the exception that raises the current exception.
`Throwable(String msg, Throwable cause)` -  The msg string is the exception message. The exception that raises the current exception is the cause here.

Methods Of Throwable class:

`getCause()` -  The real cause of a raised exception is returned by this method.
`initCause(Throwable cause)` - The cause of the calling exception is set by this method.

73. What is try-with-resources statement in Java?

![Easy](htts://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

- A try statement that declares one or more resources is called a try-with-resources statement. Examples of resources are input and output stream, a database connection, etc. All such resources need to be closed at the end of the program execution. This statement ensures that the code closes the resources that were opened by the try keyword.

- The below example reads the first line of a file via an instance of BufferedReader.  BufferedReader is the resource here that needs to be closed after its usage in the program.  

```java

static String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException { 
    try (BufferedReader br =  new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) { 
        return br.readLine(); 
    } 
} 
 

```

- The try-with-resources is declared by declaring the resource object in parentheses immediately after the try keyword. As a BufferedReader instance is declared inside the try-with-resource statement, it will be closed even if the try statement terminates abruptly.

74. How to use exception handling with method overriding?

![Easy](htts://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

- When exception handling is used with method overriding, it causes ambiguity. The compiler gets confused as to which method definition it should follow, the one in the superclass or the subclass. Certain rules can help prevent this ambiguity while using exceptions with inheritance.
- If the parent class method does not throw exceptions, the overriding class method should throw only unchecked exceptions. A checked exception will result in a compilation error.
- In the case of the parent class method throws checked exceptions, the child class method may throw any unchecked exception as well as any or all of the checked exceptions thrown by the superclass.
- The child class can also declare a few checked exceptions that the parent class does not throw, but it needs to ensure that the scope of such checked exceptions in the child class is narrower as compared to the parent class.
- When the superclass throws an unchecked exception, the subclass method can throw either none or any number of unrelated unchecked exceptions.

75.  Is it necessary that each try block must be followed by a  catch block?

![Easy](htts://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

No it is not mandatory that there should be a catch block after a try block. try block can have only a matching finally block. So there are these valid combnations try-catch-finally, try-catch, try-finally.

76.What is Exception Propagation?

![Easy](htts://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

When an exceptional condition occurs within a method, the method (where the exception occurred) creates an Exception Object and throws it. The created exception object contains information about the error, its type and the state of the program when the error occurred. The method where the exception is thrown may handle that exception itself or pass it on. In case it passes it on, run time system goes through the method hierarchy that had been called to get to the current method to search for a method that can handle the exception.If your program is not able to catch any particular exception, that will ultimately be processed by the default handler. This process of going through the method stack is known as Exception propagation.

   throw new IOException("Problem in method - displayMsg - Superclass");
 	}
 	}
 public class ExceptionDemo extends Superclass{
 public void displayMsg() throws Exception{  
  System.out.println("In ExceptionDemo displayMsg()"); 
 throw new Exception("Problem in method - displayMsg - ExceptionDemo");
	 }  
	} 

```

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

Here parent class had declared IOException where as subclass has declared Exception. Exception is the super class of IOException thus it is wrong according to the rules of method overriding and exception handling. Thus the code will give compiler error.
