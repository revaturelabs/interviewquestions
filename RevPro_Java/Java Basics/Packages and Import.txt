1.In which line there will be a package name?

A.Anywhere in the code
B.Last
C.First
D.None of these

Answer:C
Explanation:Packages are used to organize classes, interfaces, enums and annotations. We can categorize and have secure access. It avoids the naming confliction. ie, We can have the same class names when they are in different packages. The first line of java program will be the package name. If the name package is not given, it will de in default package. They are two types of packages. They are,Built-in Packages - Some examples are java, util, javax and sql etc. User-defined Packages - user has to give packages name to organize.

2.Which character is used to select all classes, interfaces, enums and annotation from the package?

A.'#'
B.'$'
C.'*'
D.'@'

Answer:C
Explanation:To get the access of classes/interfaces/enumns from another package, we need to use import statement. Example: import java.util.* or import java.util.Scanner. The special character * is used to select all classes, interfaces, enums and annotation from the package. We can also import the particular class of the package which will avoid neccessary imports and increases the performance.

4.Is com._12example a valid package name?

A.Yes
B.No

Answer:No
Explanation:To avoid naming collision in name with class interface, the package name should be in small letters.The naming should be in reverse form of the domain. If the domain is example.com, the package name should be com.example which is reverse form of domain. We can add subpackages along with com.example like com.example.packagename. The special characters are not allowed for naming a packages.If the domain contains number, we have to use underscore. 12example.com domain can be coverted as package name as com._12example.
