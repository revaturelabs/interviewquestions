6. Consider that a class extends the interface Elevator, Which of the following is true?

interface  Electrical{
	void controlLight();
	void controlAC();
}

interface Mechnical{
	void pullUp();
	void pullDown();
}

interface Elevator extends Electrical, Mechnical{
	
	int goUP();
	int goDown();

}

    A. The concrete class that implemnets Elevator, must override the methods of evelator, overriding methods of Electrical and Mechanical is optional.
    B. The concrete class that implements Elevator, must override all the methdos of all the interface.
    C. class can not implement Elevator because an interface can not extend more than one interface.
