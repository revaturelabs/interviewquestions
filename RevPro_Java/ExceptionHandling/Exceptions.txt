47.Default exception handling can be defined as___

A.The exception object contains the name and description of the exception and the current state of the program where the exception has occurred. Creating the Exception Object and handling it in the run-time system is called throwing an Exception.
B.The object contains the name and description of the current state of the program where the exception has occurred.
C.In the try catch statement
D.In the throws statement

Answer:A
Explanation:The run-time system searches the call stack to find the method that contains a block of code that can handle the occurred exception. The block of the code is called an Exception handler.The run-time system starts searching from the method in which the exception occurred, and proceeds through the call stack in the reverse order in which methods were called.If it finds an appropriate handler, then it passes the occurred exception to it. An appropriate handler means the type of the exception object thrown matches the type of the exception object it can handle. If the run-time system searches all the methods on the call stack and couldn’t have found the appropriate handler, then the run-time system handover the Exception Object to the default exception handler, which is part of the run-time system. This handler prints the exception information in the following format and terminates the program abnormally.
