2.Can we do typecasting for both primitive and reference type?

A.No.
B.Yes.

Answer:B.
Explanation:Type casting is the process of changing variable from one datatype to another datatype. Type casting is possible for both primitive and reference type. For primitive types we have values being wither widen or narrow depdending upon source and destination data type. For refernce types, type casting make sense only when there is inheritance relationship exist between the source and destination type, in that case we say upcasting (child object casted to parent) or downcasting(parent object casted to child) casting.
