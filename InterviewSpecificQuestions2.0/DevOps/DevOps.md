<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- The steps or phases for DevOps refers to the creation, testing, and deployment of an application.
    - Source code Control: Producing (writing) code and pushing to a repository
    - Building and Testing Automation: Test basic functionality of code (Generally unit testing) and create a new, working build
    - Deploying to Staging: Deployment of working build to a temporary environment
    - Acceptance Testing: Undergo other more complex tests (systems, integration) within temporary environment
    - Deployment of Build: Migrate working build to Production environment accessible by end users

6. What do you understand by Continuous Delivery?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- Development principle which focuses on the automation of the DevOps pipeline to the extent that human intervention is not required. 
- Generally, source code control, building and testing, and deployment to staging are automated.
- While acceptance testing and if necessary, deployment to production environment may be handled by a Human or requires manual approval.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- Continuous deployment automates releasing an application to production. 
- There is no manual gate at the stage of the pipeline before production (like Continuous Delivery).
- Any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production.
