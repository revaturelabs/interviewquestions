<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is an approach to programming where software is primarily designed by using objects (essentially data) that interact with each other. 

- When different pieces of data are put together, they come to form the software. OOP is an alternative to functional or procedural programming and it’s also the approach used by C#.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

Actually, there is no difference. The `string` keyword is an alias for the `System.String` class. Therefore `System.String` and `string` keywords both are the same, and we can use whichever naming convention we prefer. The String class provides many methods for safely creating, manipulating, and comparing strings.

<blockquote> 

Destructor is used to clean up the memory and free the resources. But in C#, this is done by the garbage collector on its own. `System.GC.Collect()` is called internally for cleaning up. But sometimes it may be necessary to implement destructors manually.

For Example:

```C#
~Car()
{
    Console.writeline(“….”);

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

The four fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming are:

**Encapsulation**: Here, the internal representation of an object is hidden from the view outside the object’s definition. Only the required information can be accessed whereas the rest of the data implementation is hidden.
**Abstraction**: It is a process of identifying the critical behaviour and data of an object and eliminating the irrelevant details.
**Inheritance**: It is the ability to create new classes from another class. It is done by accessing, modifying and extending the behaviour of objects in the parent class.
**Polymorphism**: The name means, one name, many forms. It is achieved by having multiple methods with the same name but different implementations.

13. What do you understand by static class in C#?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

Static Classes are created using a `static` keyword, if any class is marked as static it means we can't create an object of that class and the compiler will guarantee that instances (object) of this class cannot be created., just why because static classes are loaded automatically by the .NET Framework common language runtime (CLR).

**Characteristics of a static class are** :

- Static classes are sealed and therefore cannot be inherited.
- Contains only static members and static constructors.
- Static variables are stored in the heap memory.
- You can access the members of a static class by using the class name itself. 
- Static class can be public.

15. Can u explain a bit about partial class?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

The `partial` keyword indicates that other parts of the class, struct, or interface can be defined in the namespace. All the parts must use the `partial` keyword.

When we work on a large project and write the code in a single .cs file. It is possible to include more than one type in a single class file, but a single type's code cannot be split into sections into multiple separate files. That's why, Microsoft decided to overcome the above issue, with the introduction of something called partial types.

**Characteristics of partial class**

- Each part of a partial class should be in the same assembly or DLL.
- A partial class is only possible in the same namespace and same assembly.
- The partial class must be prefixed with the partial keyword.
- We can apply inheritance on partial class.

16. What is an abstract class?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- An Abstract class is a class which is denoted by an abstract keyword and can be used only as a Base class. This class should always be inherited. An instance of the class itself cannot be created. If we do not want any program to create an object of a class, then such classes can be made abstract.

- Any method in the abstract class does not have implementations in the same class. But they must be implemented in the child’s class.

For Example:

```C#
abstract class AB1
{
    Public void Add();
}
Class childClass : AB1
{
    childClass cs = new childClass ();
    int Sum = cs.Add();
}
```

- All the methods in an abstract class are implicitly virtual methods. Hence, the virtual keyword should not be used with any methods in the abstract class.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

Extension methods are special static methods in a static class which enables us to add new methods to built-in types and custom types without creating new derived type. Which provides a user-defined custom functionality just like built-in methods have. For Example, String has ToLower(), ToUpper() methods. In the same way, we can create our own method.

Let's check the following example, we have created Remove() method which removes any given character/string from the original string.

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        string sample1 = "This, is a, sample string";

        Console.WriteLine("output string : " + sample1.Remove(","));

- Properties are special types of methods that provide a flexible mechanism for classes for exposing private fields. Hence these are called accessors.


- There are two types of accessors under properties. These are:

  - The get property accessors.
  - The set property accessors.
- These accessors are used to get, set as well as compute class member values.

**The uses of different C# properties are:**

- Properties have to be either read-only or write-only.
- Every property holds some specific logic while setting values for any particular work.
- Fields in properties are contained within the class private so that they cannot be accessed from another class or outside the class's scope straightforwardly.

30. What is Constructor Overloading?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote>

Constructor Overloading allows us to call a different constructor based on the input parameters we’ve provided when creating a new instance of the class. For each accepted parameter scenario, we must define the constructor to be used. We can have as many constructor overloads as you wish.

We’ve added another constructor function that accepts a single-string input in the example below. If an input is provided, it will set the name variable to that of the input value.

```C#
class Sample
{
    public string name;
    public DateTime created_date;
    public List<string> topics;
    public string description;
    public bool draft;

    public Sample()
    {
        //This is the initial constructor method and will be used if no parameter is passed
        this.name = "Draft"; 
        this.created_date = DateTime.Now;
        this.topics = new List<string>();
        this.description = "Description";
        this.draft =  true; 
    }

    public S_Class(string name)
    {
        //This is the second constructor method and will be used if you pass a single string parameter
        //Instead of the name variable being set to "Tutorial Draft", it will be set to the value of the input parameter
        this.name = name;
        this.created_date = DateTime.Now;

`this` keyword is used to refer to instance members of the current class from within an instance method or a constructor. It removes name ambiguity between method parameters and instance variables if they have the same name. 

Following are some uses of ‘this’ keyword in C#:

- It can be used to invoke any method of the current object.
- It can be used to invoke another constructor from the constructor of the same class.
- It can be used as a parameter for a method call that takes the object of the same class as a parameter.

Yes, an interface can inherit from another interface in C#. It is possible for a class to inherit an interface multiple times, through base classes or interfaces it inherits. In this case, the class can only implement the interface one time if it is declared as part of the new class. If the inherited interface is not declared as part of the new class, its implementation is provided by the base class that declared it. It is possible for a base class to implement interface members using virtual members; in that case, the class inheriting the interface can change the interface behaviour by overriding the virtual members.

- For hiding the base class method from the derived class, simply declare the derived class method with the new keyword.
Whereas in C#, for overriding the base class method in a derived class, you need to declare the base class method as virtual, and the derived class method as overridden.
- If a method is simply hidden then the implementation to call is based on the compile-time type of the argument "this".
Whereas if a method is overridden then the implementation to be called is based on the run-time type of the argument "this".

We can't use `this` in the static method because the keyword `this` returns a reference to the current instance of the class containing it. Static methods (or any static member) do not belong to a particular instance.

No, We cannot make a change in the method of interface just why because the interface is publicly exposed for construction, so interface methods are public by default.
If you want to change access specifier of members may you have to go for an abstract class instead of the interface.

<blockquote>
 
An abstract class has a protected constructor (by default) allowing derived types to initialize it.
An abstract type is defined largely as one that can't be created. You can create subtypes of it, but not of that type itself. The CLI will not let you do this.

Yes, they can be used inside the method declared with the unsafe modifier or within the unsafe block.

unsafe {  
    int a = 15; 
    *b = &a;
    Console.WriteLine(*b); 
          }
Do not forget to specify ‘Allow unsafe code’ in the project properties.

 Enums do not support inheritance since they are value type and therefore are sealed. Enum is like a struct.it is having the nature of the sealed class. so it doesn't support inheritance.

52.Explain the concept of dependency inversion in C#, and how it contributes to creating flexible and maintainable code in OOP. Provide a real-world example to support your explanation.

<blockquote>   
  
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the SOLID design principles that promotes creating flexible and maintainable code in OOP. The principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. In other words, classes should depend on interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete implementations.

The main benefits of adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle include:

Decoupling: By depending on abstractions, classes are less coupled to specific implementations, making the code more modular and easier to change.
Reusability: Abstracting dependencies allows for better code reuse, as common interfaces can be shared among multiple classes.
Testability: When classes depend on abstractions, it becomes easier to write unit tests by replacing actual dependencies with mock objects or stubs.

53.How can you achieve encapsulation in C# without using access modifiers like private, protected, or internal? Are there any alternative techniques or patterns to achieve this?
    
![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
Encapsulation is an essential principle in OOP that involves hiding the internal state and implementation details of an object while exposing a well-defined interface for interaction. In C#, access modifiers such as private, protected, and internal are commonly used to achieve encapsulation by controlling the visibility of class members.

However, there are alternative techniques and patterns to achieve encapsulation without relying solely on access modifiers:

Use properties: Properties in C# can be used to encapsulate fields by exposing them through getter and setter methods. This approach allows you to control how the internal state is accessed and modified, providing validation and other logic when necessary. 

Use composition: Composition can be used to encapsulate complex behavior or functionality within separate classes, exposing only the necessary interface to interact with the composed objects. This approach promotes separation of concerns and encapsulation of implementation details.
    
Use the Facade pattern: The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, encapsulating the details of the subsystem and making it easier to use. This pattern can be used to hide the complexity of a set of related classes or methods, exposing a more straightforward interface for clients.

54.In C#, how can you achieve immutability in a class, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of using immutable objects in an application?
    
![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
   
Immutability is a property of an object that ensures its state cannot be changed after it has been created. In C#, you can achieve immutability in a class by making its fields read-only and initializing them during object   construction.
    
chieving immutability in a class
Here’s an example of implementing an immutable class in C#:

public class ImmutablePerson
{
    public string FirstName { get; }
    public string LastName { get; }

    public ImmutablePerson(string firstName, string lastName)
    {
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
    }
}
In this example, the ImmutablePerson class has two read-only properties, FirstName and LastName, that are initialized in the constructor. Once an instance of ImmutablePerson is created, its state cannot be changed.

 55.What is the purpose of the IDisposable interface in C# OOP, and how does it relate to the proper management of resources within an application? Provide a practical example of its usage.
    
 ![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

 <blockquote> 
  
 The IDisposable interface in C# OOP provides a standardized way for classes to release unmanaged resources, such as file handles, network connections, or database connections, that may be acquired during their lifetime. Implementing IDisposable helps ensure the proper management of resources within an application by allowing developers to explicitly release resources when they are no longer needed, preventing resource leaks and improving overall performance and stability.
     
public class FileStreamWrapper : IDisposable
{
    private FileStream _fileStream;

    public FileStreamWrapper(string filePath)
    {
        _fileStream = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Open);
    }

    // Read and write file operations

    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (_fileStream != null)
        {
            _fileStream.Dispose();
            _fileStream = null;
        }
    }
}
