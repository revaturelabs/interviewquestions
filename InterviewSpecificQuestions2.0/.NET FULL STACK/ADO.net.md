4. What is a .NET data provider?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

A .NET data provider is a software library consisting of classes that provide data access services such as connecting to a data source, executing commands at a data source, and fetching data from a data source with support to execute commands within transactions. It resides as a lightweight layer between data source and code, providing data access services with increased performance.

The .NET data provider is a component of ADO.NET, a subset of the .NET framework class library.

In ADO.NET, we can connect to your database with the help of the following namespaces:

- **Data**: This namespace is used to carry the data tables from the database and can hold columns, relations, multiple tables, views and constraints.
- **Data.SqlClient**: This namespace is used to connect the .NET application with the Microsoft SQL Database by using the miscellaneous classes such as SqlConnection, SqlCommand, SqlDataAdapter etc.
- **Data.Odbc**: This namespace is used to connect with the ODBC drivers by using OdbcCommand and OdbcConnection.
- **Data.OracleClient**: This namespace is used to describe a collection of classes to access an Oracle data source.

**Data Grid**: Data Grid provides many features and functionality to users to perform paging and sort the data in the table easily. It can hold text object data, but it can’t hold embedded or linked object data.
**Data Repeater**: Data Repeater has offered so many features that are not offered by Data Grid such as – It can hold control of embedded and linked objects data and it can embed Data Grid in it but vice-versa is not possible. It doesn’t have support for Paging functionality but can be achieved by programming it.

14. What is Connection pooling?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- Connection pooling refers to the task of grouping database connections in the cache to make them reusable because opening new connections every time to a database is a time-consuming process. 
- Therefore, connection pooling enables us to reuse already existing and active database connections, whenever required, increasing the performance of our application.
- We can enable or disable connection pooling in your application by setting the pooling property to either true or false in the connection string. By default, it is enabled in an application.

15. Why is it important to close an ADO.NET application?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- Connections need to be closed properly because it affects the scalability and reliability of the applications.
- Open connections are always vulnerable to attack, so to be short, `Open connections as late as possible and close them as early as possible`. We can close the connections by **final** block or ‘using’ the `USING statement`.

<blockquote> 

- Databinding is the process of binding the data with graphical elements (controls in a window form). After binding the data in a window form, you can navigate through the records with the help of the Binding Navigator Control.
- One of the advantages of data binding is, the user does not need to write the codes explicitly, for establishing the connections and creating a data set, this feature will write the necessary ADO.NET code for the user.

18. What is the difference between a Typed and Untyped Dataset?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

The differences are explained below:

**Typed Dataset**: 
 - A typed dataset is derived from the Dataset class and has an associated XML schema, which is created at the time of the creation of the dataset.
 - The XML schema contains information about the dataset structure such as tables, columns, and rows. Data is transferred from a database into a dataset and from the dataset to another component in the XML format.

**Untyped Dataset**: Untyped dataset doesn’t have an XML schema associated with it. Untyped Dataset, the tables, and columns are represented as a collection.
