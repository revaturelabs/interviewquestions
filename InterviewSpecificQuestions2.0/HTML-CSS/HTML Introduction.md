<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Yes, a webpage can have many `<header>` and `<footer>` elements. Both tags are specifically designed to serve their respective purposes with respect to their parent section.

Hence, not only the page `<body>` must have the `<header>` and `<footer>` tags, but also does every `<article>` and `<section>` elements. Although a `<footer>` element might not be always necessary for every `<article>` and `<section>` tags, a `<header>` element must always be there.

4. How do you set language in HTML?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

There are multiple ways to set language in HTML:
  - By setting content-language in headers for language of the page.
  - By setting accept-language in headers for list of language that a page accepts.
  - Setting lang attribute in html tag.

5. What does a `<DOCTYPE html>` do?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

A **DOCTYPE** is always associated to a DTD ( Document Type Definition ). A DTD defines how documents of a certain type should be structured (i.e. a button can contain a span but not a div), whereas a **DOCTYPE** declares what DTD a document supposedly respects (i.e. this document respects the HTML DTD). For webpages, the **DOCTYPE** declaration is required. It is used to tell user agents what version of the HTML specifications your document respects.

Once a user agent has recognized a correct **DOCTYPE**, it will trigger the no-quirks mode matching this **DOCTYPE** for reading the document. If a user agent doesn't recognize a correct **DOCTYPE**, it will trigger the quirks mode.

6. What is difference between span **tag** and **div** tag?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

The primary difference between div and span tag is their default behavior. By default, a `<div>` is a block-level-element and a `<span>` is an inline element.

`<div>` is a block level element which means it will render it on its own line with a width of a 100% of the parent element.
`<span>` is an inline element which means it will render on the same line as the previous element, if it is also an inline element, and it's width will be determined by its content.

```HTML
<div>Demo Text, with <span>some other</span> text.</div>
```

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

The HTML `<main>` element represents the dominant content of the `<body>` of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.

```HTML
<main role="main">
    <p>Geckos are a group of usually small, usually nocturnal lizards. 
       They are found on every continent except Australia.</p>
    <p>Many species of gecko have adhesive toe pads which enable them to climb walls and even windows.</p>
</main>
```

**Note:** A document mustn't have more than one `<main>` element that doesn't have the hidden attribute specified.

26. Explain Drag and Drop in HTML5?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

HTML5 drag-and-drop uses the DOM event model and drag events inherited from mouse events. A typical drag operation begins when a user selects a draggable element, drags the element to a droppable element, and then releases the dragged element.

**Example**
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
   <head>
   <script>
        function allowDrop(ev) {
            ev.preventDefault();
        }

        function drag(ev) {
            ev.dataTransfer.setData("text", ev.target.id);
        }

        function drop(ev) {
            ev.preventDefault();
            var data = ev.dataTransfer.getData("text");
            ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="div1" ondrop="drop(event)" ondragover="allowDrop(event)"></div>
  <img id="drag1" src="img_logo.gif" draggable="true" ondragstart="drag(event)" width="336" height="69">
