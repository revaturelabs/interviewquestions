<blockquote>

CSS3 element selector helps to find out the HTML elements name which we want to apply in a style sheet. It has five categories. They are

`Attribute Selectors`: Find an attribute or attribute value of an HTML element.
`Combinator Selectors`: Find a specific relationship between elements.
`Simple Selectors`: Find a name, id, or class of an element.
`Pseudo Class Selectors`: Find a certain state of an element.
`Pseudo Elements Selectors`: Find the style part and select an element.

Example:

```CSS
P {
text-align: left;
Color: blue
```
In the output element P will be left aligned with the blue text color.
