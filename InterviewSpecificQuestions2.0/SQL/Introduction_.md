<blockquote>

**Java**

*MongoDB*

To connect to a MongoDB database in Java, you can use the MongoDB Java driver. Here's an example of connecting to a MongoDB database using the driver:

```java

import com.mongodb.client.MongoClients;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoClient;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;

// Connection URI
String connectionString = "mongodb://localhost:27017";

// Database name
String databaseName = "mydatabase";

// Create a MongoDB client
MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(connectionString);

// Get the database
MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase(databaseName);
```

In this example, we create a MongoClient object using the `MongoClients.create()` method and the connectionString variable, which specifies the connection string. We then use this client to get the mydatabase database using the databaseName variable.

*PostgreSQL*

To connect to a PostgreSQL database in Java, you can use the JDBC driver. Here's an example of connecting to a PostgreSQL database using the driver:

```java

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

// Connection details
String databaseHost = "localhost";
String databasePort = "5432";
String databaseName = "mydatabase";
String databaseUser = "myuser";
String databasePassword = "mypassword";

// Connection string
String connectionString = String.format("jdbc:postgresql://%s:%s/%s", databaseHost, databasePort, databaseName);

// Connect to the database
Connection connection = null;
try {
    connection = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionString, databaseUser, databasePassword);
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    if (connection != null) {
        try {
            connection.close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, we create a connection string using the `String.format()` method, which takes the database host, port, and name as parameters. We then use this connection string to create a connection using the `DriverManager.getConnection()` method, passing in the username and password as parameters. Note that you will need to download and add the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to your project to use this code.

**C#**

*MongoDB*

To connect to a MongoDB database in C#, you can use the official MongoDB .NET driver. Here's an example of connecting to a MongoDB database using this driver:

```csharp

using MongoDB.Driver;

// Connection string
string connectionString = "mongodb://localhost:27017";

// Database name
string databaseName = "mydatabase";

// Create a MongoDB client
var client = new MongoClient(connectionString);

// Get the database
var database = client.GetDatabase(databaseName);
```

In this example, we create a MongoClient object using the connection string, and then use this client to get the mydatabase database.

*PostgreSQL*

To connect to a PostgreSQL database in C#, you can use the Npgsql library. Here's an example of connecting to a PostgreSQL database using Npgsql:

```csharp

using Npgsql;

// Connection details
string host = "localhost";
string port = "5432";
string databaseName = "mydatabase";
string username = "myuser";
string password = "mypassword";

// Connection string
string connectionString = $"Host={host};Port={port};Database={databaseName};Username={username};Password={password}";

// Connect to the database
var connection = new NpgsqlConnection(connectionString);
connection.Open();
```

In this example, we create a connection string using the `NpgsqlConnection` class, which takes the database name, username, password, host, and port as parameters. We then use this connection to execute queries. Note that you will need to install the Npgsql library to use this code.

**Python**

*MongoDB*

To connect to a MongoDB database in Python, you can use the PyMongo library. Here's an example of connecting to a MongoDB database using PyMongo:

```python

from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connection string
uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017"

# Database name
database_name = "mydatabase"

# Create a MongoDB client
client = MongoClient(uri)

# Get the database
database = client[database_name]
```

In this example, we create a MongoClient object using the connection string, and then use this client to get the mydatabase database.

*PostgreSQL*

To connect to a PostgreSQL database in Python, you can use the Psycopg2 library. Here's an example of connecting to a PostgreSQL database using Psycopg2:

```python

import psycopg2

# Connection details
host = "localhost"
port = "5432"
database_name = "mydatabase"
username = "myuser"
password = "mypassword"

# Connection string
connection_string = f"host={host} port={port} dbname={database_name} user={username} password={password}"

# Connect to the database
connection = psycopg2.connect(connection_string)
```

In this example, we create a connection string using the Psycopg2 library, which takes the database name, username, password, host, and port as parameters. We then use this connection to execute queries. Note that you will need to install the Psycopg2 library to use this code.

2. What is a relational database?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

A relational database is a type of database that stores and organizes data in a tabular form, with each row representing a unique record and each column representing a specific attribute of that record. In a relational database, data is organized into tables, which can be related to each other using common fields. The relationships between tables are defined by primary and foreign keys, which ensure that data is stored in a consistent and structured manner. Relational databases are widely used in business and enterprise applications, as well as in web and mobile applications.

6. Can you differentiate between RDBMS and NoSQL? 

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>


RDBMS and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems. Here's a brief overview of their differences:

*Data model*: RDBMS follows a relational data model, which means data is organized in tables with predefined relationships between them. NoSQL, on the other hand, follows a non-relational data model, which means data can be organized in a variety of ways, such as key-value pairs, document-based, or graph-based.

*Schema*: RDBMS has a rigid schema, which means the structure of the database is predefined and cannot be changed without altering the schema. NoSQL, on the other hand, has a flexible schema, which means the structure of the database can be changed without affecting the data.

*Scalability*: RDBMS is vertically scalable, which means it can handle more data by adding more resources to a single server. NoSQL, on the other hand, is horizontally scalable, which means it can handle more data by adding more servers to a distributed system.

*Transactions*: RDBMS supports ACID transactions, which ensures data consistency and reliability. NoSQL, on the other hand, does not necessarily support ACID transactions and may prioritize other features such as scalability or availability.

7. What is Normalization?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Normalization refers to the process of organizing data in a database in such a way that it reduces redundancy and dependency among the data. This helps to improve data consistency and accuracy while reducing data anomalies and inconsistencies. 
- In other words, normalization ensures that data is structured in a way that minimizes redundancy and maximizes efficiency, making it easier to store, update, and retrieve information. 
- Normalization typically involves breaking down large tables into smaller ones and creating relationships between them, so that each piece of data is stored only once and related data is stored in separate tables.

8. How do we decide not to normalize a table? 

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

There are situations where normalization may not be the best approach for organizing data in a table. Here are some examples:

*When performance is a priority*: Normalization can sometimes result in complex joins and slower query performance. In cases where performance is a key requirement, denormalization can be used to store redundant data in a single table to improve query speed.

*When the data is small and simple*: If the data is relatively small and straightforward, it may not be necessary to normalize it. Normalization is most useful for complex and large datasets where reducing redundancy is important.

*When the data is temporary or temporary storage is needed*: In cases where the data is temporary or used for a short period of time, normalization may not be necessary. In these cases, it may be more convenient to store the data in a single table, without worrying about normalization.

*When the data is highly variable*: In some cases, the data may have highly variable structure or content, making normalization difficult. In such cases, it may be more appropriate to store the data in a less structured format, such as a NoSQL database.

9.  Differentiate between BigData and RDBMS?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Yes, there are some key differences between big data and RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems):

*Data Structure*: RDBMS relies on a structured approach to data storage, where data is stored in tables with fixed columns and rows. Big data, on the other hand, can be both structured and unstructured and doesn't require a fixed schema. This allows for more flexible storage of data that can be processed and analyzed in various ways.

*Scalability*: RDBMS typically has limitations on scalability due to its structured approach to data storage. Big data, on the other hand, is designed to handle large volumes of data and can scale horizontally to accommodate growing data volumes.

*Processing*: RDBMS typically relies on SQL queries to process data, which can be limiting in terms of the types of analysis that can be performed. Big data, on the other hand, relies on distributed computing technologies such as Hadoop and Spark, which allow for parallel processing of data across multiple nodes, enabling more complex and sophisticated analysis.

*Data Variety*: RDBMS typically works well with structured data but struggles with unstructured data such as text, images, and videos. Big data, on the other hand, can handle both structured and unstructured data, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.

10. What is the difference between SQL and MongoDB?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

SQL and MongoDB are both database technologies, but they differ in several ways:

*Data Model*: SQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS), which means it stores data in tables with fixed columns and rows. MongoDB, on the other hand, is a NoSQL document database, which means it stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

*Query Language*: SQL uses a standardized query language called SQL (Structured Query Language) to retrieve data from tables. MongoDB uses its own query language, which is based on JSON and allows for more flexible querying of documents.

*Scalability*: SQL databases can scale vertically (by adding more CPU, memory, or storage to a single server) but have limitations in horizontal scalability (adding more servers to a cluster). MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, which makes it easier to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.

*Data Consistency*: SQL databases are typically ACID compliant, which ensures data consistency and integrity. MongoDB, on the other hand, is designed for high availability and scalability, which means it may sacrifice some consistency in favor of availability and performance.

- SQL is a mature and reliable technology that is best suited for structured data storage and retrieval, while MongoDB is a more flexible and scalable technology that is ideal for handling unstructured data and high-traffic applications.

11. How to set up a database?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Setting up a database involves the following steps:

*Identify the purpose and scope of the database*: The first step is to identify the purpose of the database and the scope of the data that will be stored in it. This will help determine the requirements for the database, including its structure, security, and performance.

*Choose a database management system (DBMS)*: Once the requirements have been identified, the next step is to choose a DBMS that meets those requirements. Popular DBMS options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, and SQL Server.

*Design the database schema*: The database schema is the blueprint for how data will be organized and stored in the database. This involves identifying the tables, fields, and relationships that will be used to represent the data.

*Define data types and constraints*: Each field in the database must have a defined data type, such as text, integer, or date. Constraints can also be defined to ensure data consistency and integrity, such as unique keys, foreign keys, and check constraints.

*Implement the database schema*: With the database schema defined, the next step is to create the database and tables, and define the fields and relationships.

*Populate the database with data*: Once the database has been set up, it can be populated with data. This can be done manually or by importing data from external sources.

*Test and optimize the database*: The final step is to test the database and optimize it for performance. This involves running queries and monitoring system resources to ensure that the database is running efficiently and meeting performance requirements. Indexes and other optimizations may also be added to improve query performance.

13. What are the relationships in RDBMS?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

In a relational database management system (RDBMS), there are three main types of relationships between tables:

*One-to-one (1:1) relationship*: This relationship exists when each record in one table is associated with exactly one record in another table, and vice versa.

*One-to-many (1:N) relationship*: This relationship exists when each record in one table is associated with one or more records in another table, but each record in the second table is associated with only one record in the first table.

*Many-to-many (N:M) relationship*: This relationship exists when each record in one table is associated with one or more records in another table, and each record in the second table is associated with one or more records in the first table.

17. What is Dynamic Hashing?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Dynamic hashing is a technique used in database systems to manage hash tables with a flexible size that can be increased or decreased as needed to store and retrieve data efficiently. It handles collisions by splitting and rehashing the table or combining it with a neighbor, depending on the number of records stored in it. This approach is commonly used in applications that handle large amounts of data.

19. What is Referential Integrity?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Referential Integrity is a feature in RDBMS that ensures the consistency and accuracy of data relationships between tables. It enforces rules for how related data should be handled when changes are made to the data to maintain data integrity. This is typically done through the use of foreign keys, which refer to the primary key of another table.
