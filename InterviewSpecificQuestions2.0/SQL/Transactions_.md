The maximum number of records returned by a trigger at once depends on the database system being used. Different database systems have different limitations and it's important to consult the documentation of your specific database to determine the limit.

30. Explain the different isolation levels

<blockquote>

Isolation levels in database systems define the level of concurrent access and transactional consistency in a multi-user environment. The different isolation levels provide varying degrees of data integrity, performance, and concurrency control. Here's an explanation of the commonly used isolation levels:

- **Read Uncommitted:** Allows reading uncommitted changes made by other transactions. Low level of isolation, high concurrency, but can lead to dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

- **Read Committed:** Allows reading only committed data, ignoring uncommitted changes. Prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads. Better data consistency than Read Uncommitted.

- **Repeatable Read:** Ensures data read during the transaction remains unchanged. Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads but can result in phantom reads. Acquires shared locks on read data.

- **Serializable:** Provides the highest level of isolation. Transactions execute in a serializable order. Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads. Can reduce concurrency and may lead to more conflicts and rollbacks.

31. What is a transaction within a relational database?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

- A transaction in a relational database is a sequence of database operations that are treated as a single unit of work. 
- Independent of other transactions
- It ensures that all the operations within the transaction are either completed successfully or rolled back if an error occurs.
- If anything fails, the whole transaction fails

32. What is nested transaction? Explain with an example.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

A nested transaction is one in which a new transaction is started by an instruction that is already inside another transaction. This new transaction is said to be nested. The isolation property of transaction is obeyed here because the changes made by the nested transaction are not seen or interrupted by the host transaction.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION OuterTransaction

  -- Perform some database operations
  -- ...

  BEGIN TRANSACTION NestedTransaction

    -- Perform some nested database operations
    -- ...

    IF condition THEN
      COMMIT TRANSACTION NestedTransaction
    ELSE
      ROLLBACK TRANSACTION NestedTransaction
    END IF

  END TRANSACTION NestedTransaction

  -- Continue with more operations within the outer transaction
  -- ...

COMMIT TRANSACTION OuterTransaction

```
In this example, we have an outer transaction called OuterTransaction that contains a nested transaction called NestedTransaction. The nested transaction can perform its own set of operations and is either committed or rolled back based on a condition. The changes made within the nested transaction are isolated until the outer transaction is committed.

33. How can you ensure that a group of SQL statements is treated as a single unit of work within a transaction?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

To ensure that a group of SQL statements is treated as a single unit of work within a transaction:

- Begin the transaction using the BEGIN TRANSACTION statement.
- Execute the desired SQL statements within the transaction.
- Handle errors and exceptions to ensure proper rollback if needed.
- Commit the transaction to make the changes permanent or rollback to discard the changes.

34. How do you handle exceptions or errors within a transaction and ensure proper rollback of changes?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

To handle exceptions or errors within a transaction and ensure proper rollback of changes:

- Use try-catch blocks or error handling mechanisms within your programming language or database system.
- Catch any exceptions or errors that occur during the execution of the transaction.
- Rollback the transaction using the ROLLBACK statement to undo any changes made within the transaction.
- Handle the exception or error appropriately, such as logging the error, notifying the user, or taking corrective actions.
- Optionally, you can also provide a mechanism to retry the transaction or perform any necessary cleanup tasks.
- Ensure that the error handling code is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not to properly handle both successful and unsuccessful transactions.

35. How do you design a transactional system that maintains consistency and avoids data anomalies in concurrent environments?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

To design a transactional system that maintains consistency and avoids data anomalies in concurrent environments:

- Choose the appropriate isolation level for transactions to ensure concurrency and consistency.
- Clearly define transaction boundaries to encapsulate related database operations.
- Use locking and concurrency control mechanisms to prevent access issues and maintain data integrity.
- Handle conflicts and deadlocks that may arise during concurrent access.
- Consider optimistic concurrency control - techniques to handle concurrent updates.
- Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to maintain system integrity.
- Properly manage transaction commit and rollback.
- Thoroughly test and tune the system for different concurrency scenarios.
- Continuously monitor and analyze system behavior for concurrency, consistency, and performance issues.
- Follow established best practices and design patterns for consistency, reliability, and scalability.
