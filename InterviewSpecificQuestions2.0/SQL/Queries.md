1. How do you get the second highest salary from the database?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b>MySQL</b></summary>

<blockquote>

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM employees
);
```

Explanation: In MySQL, we can find the second highest salary by using a subquery. The subquery `(SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees)` retrieves the maximum salary from the `employees` table. The outer query then selects the maximum salary from the `employees` table that is less than the maximum salary, effectively giving us the second highest salary.

</blockquote>

</details>

<details><summary><b>PostgreSQL</b></summary>

<blockquote>

```sql
SELECT salary AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1;
```

Explanation: In PostgreSQL, we can find the second highest salary by ordering the salaries in descending order using `ORDER BY salary DESC`. Then, we use `OFFSET 1` to skip the first row (which has the highest salary), and `LIMIT 1` to retrieve the next row, which corresponds to the second highest salary.

2. How do you create a number list that contains only unique values while preserving the order of the numbers from another number list. 

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b>MySQL</b></summary>

<blockquote>

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT number
FROM your_table
ORDER BY (SELECT NULL);
```

Explanation: In MySQL, to create a number list with unique values while preserving the order, we can use the `DISTINCT` keyword to eliminate duplicates from the `number` column. By including `ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)`, we ensure that the result set is ordered in the same order as the original data without changing the order.

</blockquote>
</details>

<details><summary><b>PostgreSQL</b></summary>

<blockquote>

```sql
SELECT number
FROM your_table
GROUP BY number
ORDER BY MIN(ctid);
```

Explanation: In PostgreSQL, we can achieve the same result by using the `GROUP BY` clause on the `number` column. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the rows with the same `number` value, effectively removing duplicates. By including `ORDER BY MIN(ctid)`, we ensure that the result set is ordered in the same order as the original data without changing the order.

4. How do you remove duplicate values from a table without using a separate table ?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> MySQL</b></summary>

<blockquote>

To remove duplicate values from a table without using a separate table, you can use the `DELETE` statement with a self-join. Here's an example:

```sql
DELETE t1
FROM your_table t1
JOIN your_table t2 ON t1.column1 = t2.column1
                  AND t1.column2 = t2.column2
                  AND t1.id > t2.id;
```

This query deletes rows from `your_table` where there are duplicates based on the columns `column1` and `column2`. It compares each row with all other rows in the table and keeps only the row with the lowest `id` value.

Note: Replace `your_table` with the actual name of your table, and adjust the column names as per your table structure.

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, MAX(s.purchase_date) AS most_recent_purchase
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
```

Explanation: 
This query combines the `customers` and `sales` tables using an inner join on the `customer_id` column. It then uses the `GROUP BY` clause to group the rows by the `customer_id`. The `MAX()` function is applied to the `purchase_date` column to find the most recent purchase for each customer. The result includes the `customer_id` and the corresponding `most_recent_purchase` date for each customer.

12. SQL Riddle: If table T1 has 1 Column named "ID" and 2 Rows: (1;1) and table T2 has 1 Column named "ID" and 2 Rows: (1;1), how many rows would `SELECT T1.ID, T2.ID FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID` return?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

The query `SELECT T1.ID, T2.ID FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID` would return 4 rows.

Explanation:
The query performs an inner join on the `ID` column between table T1 and table T2. Since both tables have 2 rows each with the same value for `ID`, the join condition is satisfied for every combination of rows where `T1.ID` matches `T2.ID`. As a result, each row from T1 is matched with both rows from T2, resulting in a Cartesian product. Therefore, the query would return 4 rows in total.

14. What is a Subquery?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

 A subquery is a SQL query that is nested inside another query. It is also known as an inner query or nested query. A subquery is used to retrieve data that will be used by the main query to filter, group, or order the results.

For example, consider the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country IN (
    SELECT country
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= '2022-01-01'
)
```

In this query, the subquery `(SELECT country FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2022-01-01')` retrieves a list of countries that have orders placed after January 1st, 2022. This list is then used by the main query to filter the `customers` table to show only the customers from those countries.

15. How to avoid duplicates in a query?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

- `DISTINCT`: This keyword is used to remove duplicate rows from the query result set. It is placed after the `SELECT` keyword and before the columns you want to retrieve.

For example:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, column3
FROM my_table;
```

- `GROUP BY`: This clause is used to group rows with similar values in a column or set of columns. It is placed after the `SELECT` clause and before the `ORDER BY` or `HAVING` clause.

For example:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*)
FROM my_table
GROUP BY column1, column2;
```

In this example, the `GROUP BY` clause groups rows by the values in `column1` and `column2`, and the `COUNT(*)` function returns the number of rows in each group. This will avoid duplicate rows in the result set.

16.   Can you tell me how to create a new Table from another Table, where just the structure of the table is copied but none of the rows? 

<details><summary><b>MySQL</b></summary>

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table
SELECT *
FROM original_table
WHERE 1 = 0;
```

Explanation:
This MySQL query creates a new table called `new_table` by selecting all columns from the `original_table` using the `SELECT` statement. However, the `WHERE 1 = 0` condition is always false, which means no rows will be selected. As a result, the new table `new_table` will have the same structure as `original_table`, but without any rows.

</details>

<details><summary><b>PostgreSQL</b></summary>

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS
SELECT *
FROM original_table
WHERE false;
```

Explanation:
This PostgreSQL query creates a new table called `new_table` using the `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` syntax. The `SELECT` statement selects all columns from the `original_table`. The `WHERE false` condition is always false, which means no rows will be selected. As a result, the new table `new_table` will have the same structure as `original_table`, but without any rows.

```sql
SELECT 
    LENGTH('Infosys') - LENGTH(REPLACE('Infosys', 's', '')) AS count_of_s
FROM 
    your_table;
```

Explanation:
This MySQL query calculates the count of 's' characters in the string 'Infosys' by subtracting the length of the string after removing all occurrences of 's' (using the `REPLACE()` function) from the original length of the string (using the `LENGTH()` function). The result is returned as `count_of_s`.

</details>

<details><summary><b>PostgreSQL</b></summary>

```sql
SELECT 
    LENGTH('Infosys') - LENGTH(REPLACE('Infosys', 's', '', 'g')) AS count_of_s
FROM 
    your_table;
```

Explanation:
This PostgreSQL query is similar to the MySQL version. It calculates the count of 's' characters in the string 'Infosys' by subtracting the length of the string after removing all occurrences of 's' (using the `REPLACE()` function with the `'g'` flag to replace globally) from the original length of the string (using the `LENGTH()` function). The result is returned as `count_of_s`.

SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM your_table
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING count > 1;
```

Explanation:
This MySQL query selects `column1` and `column2` from the `your_table` and groups the rows by the values in these columns using `GROUP BY`. The `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the number of rows in each group. The `HAVING` clause filters the groups and returns only those groups that have a count greater than 1, indicating duplicate records.

</details>

<details><summary><b>PostgreSQL</b></summary>

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*) AS count

21. If you had 2 tables, how would you query all the records unique in the first table all the records that are unique in the second table and then all the records that they have in common.

<details><summary><b>MySQL</b></summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE table1_id NOT IN (SELECT table1_id FROM table2)
UNION
SELECT * FROM table2
WHERE table2_id NOT IN (SELECT table2_id FROM table1)
UNION
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE table1_id IN (SELECT table1_id FROM table2);
```

Explanation:
This MySQL query selects all records from `table1` where the `table1_id` is not present in `table2` (representing the unique records in the first table), then combines it with all records from `table2` where the `table2_id` is not present in `table1` (representing the unique records in the second table), and finally combines it with all records from `table1` where the `table1_id` is present in `table2` (representing the records they have in common).

</details>

<details><summary><b>PostgreSQL</b></summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT * FROM table2;
```

Explanation:
This PostgreSQL query is a more concise version. It uses the `EXCEPT` operator to select all records from `table1` that are not present in `table2` (representing the unique records in the first table), and then uses the `INTERSECT` operator to select the records that are common to both `table1` and `table2`. The result is the combination of the unique records in `table1`, unique records in `table2`, and the common records between them.

22. Given 4 tables: Members, Checking Accounts (3 types), Savings Account (3 types), Loans(3 types) write a SQL query to find the most popular products along with the number of members who are attached to each product type. 

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN ca.account_type IS NOT NULL THEN 'Checking Account'
        WHEN sa.account_type IS NOT NULL THEN 'Savings Account'
        WHEN l.loan_type IS NOT NULL THEN 'Loan'
    END AS product_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT m.member_id) AS member_count
FROM
    Members m
LEFT JOIN
    Checking_Accounts ca ON m.member_id = ca.member_id
LEFT JOIN
    Savings_Accounts sa ON m.member_id = sa.member_id
LEFT JOIN
    Loans l ON m.member_id = l.member_id
GROUP BY
    product_type
ORDER BY
    member_count DESC;
```

Explanation:
This query uses left joins to combine the `Members` table with the `Checking_Accounts`, `Savings_Accounts`, and `Loans` tables based on the common `member_id` column. It assigns the product type based on which table the join is successful. The `COUNT(DISTINCT m.member_id)` function is used to count the number of distinct members for each product type. The result is grouped by the product type and ordered by the member count in descending order.

23.   Insert into Person table


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To insert data into the `Person` table, you need to provide the specific columns and their corresponding values that you want to insert. The exact column names will depend on the schema and structure of your `Person` table. Here's an example of how an `INSERT` statement can be written:

```sql
INSERT INTO Person (first_name, last_name, age)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 25);
```

Explanation:
In this  query, the `INSERT INTO` statement is used to specify the target table, which is `Person`. The column names (`first_name`, `last_name`, `age`) are specified within parentheses after the table name. The `VALUES` keyword is used to provide the corresponding values that you want to insert for each column. In this example, we are inserting the values 'John' for `first_name`, 'Doe' for `last_name`, and 25 for `age`.

Please note that you need to adjust the column names and values based on your specific `Person` table structure. Additionally, if the table has any columns with constraints or auto-generated values, you may need to provide appropriate values or handle those constraints accordingly during the insertion.

24.   Write out an SQL query to find the most recently updated fields in a table.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To find the most recently updated fields in a table, you can utilize the timestamp or date columns in your table that track the last update time. Here's an example of how you can write an SQL query to accomplish this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Explanation:
In this query, `your_table` represents the name of your table. Assuming you have a column named `updated_at` that stores the timestamp or date of the last update, the query selects all columns from the table and orders the result set by the `updated_at` column in descending order. By using the `LIMIT 1` clause, only the most recently updated row is returned.

29.  How would you do a SQL call for employees with a salary over 150K


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To retrieve employees with a salary over $150,000 from a table, you can use the SELECT statement along with a WHERE clause to filter the results based on the salary condition. Here's an example of how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 150000;
```

Explanation:
In this query, `employees` represents the name of the table that stores employee data. The query selects all columns (`*`) from the table and uses the WHERE clause to filter the results based on the condition `salary > 150000`. This condition retrieves only the employees whose salary is greater than $150,000.

30.  How do you select only the uncommon rows in two single column tables where the first x rows have the same value (ie 2 tables: 1 is 20 rows, 1 is 15 rows, each have the same values in the first 15 rows. How do you retrieve the other 5 rows)? Is there another way that isn't the MINUS function?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To select only the uncommon rows between two single-column tables, where the first x rows have the same values, you can use various techniques such as the EXCEPT/NOT IN operator or a combination of LEFT JOIN and NULL check. Here's an example using the LEFT JOIN technique:

```sql
SELECT t1.column_name
FROM table1 t1
LEFT JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.column_name = t2.column_name
WHERE t2.column_name IS NULL;
```

Explanation:
In this MySQL query, `table1` and `table2` represent the names of the two single-column tables you want to compare. `column_name` should be replaced with the actual column name in your tables. The LEFT JOIN combines the two tables based on the common column values. The WHERE clause filters the result to include only those rows where the value in `column_name` from `table2` is NULL, indicating that the row is not present in `table2`.

31.  Write a query to select all people living in a specific city from the tables you created.


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

- `Persons` table with columns: `person_id`, `name`
- `Addresses` table with columns: `address_id`, `person_id`, `city`

Here's an example query to select all people living in a specific city:

```sql
SELECT p.name
FROM Persons p
JOIN Addresses a ON p.person_id = a.person_id
WHERE a.city = 'specific_city';
```

Explanation:
In this MySQL query, we join the `Persons` and `Addresses` tables using the `person_id` column. We select the `name` column from the `Persons` table. The `JOIN` operation combines the matching rows between the two tables. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the results based on the specified city, which should be replaced with the actual name of the specific city you want to query.

32.    What can I use to speed up a specific query in SQL?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>


There are several ways to speed up a specific query in SQL:

1. Optimize the query: Review the query and optimize it to use the most efficient methods to retrieve the data. This may include optimizing the SELECT statement, using appropriate indexes, and reducing the number of joins.

2. Use indexes: Indexes can speed up queries by allowing the database to quickly find the data it needs. Make sure the columns being queried are properly indexed.

3. Cache data: Caching data can speed up queries that are frequently run. This involves storing frequently accessed data in memory, which reduces the number of times the database needs to access the disk.

4. Partition tables: If a table is very large, partitioning it into smaller tables can speed up queries that only need to access a subset of the data.

5. Upgrade hardware: If the database server is underpowered, upgrading the hardware can improve performance.

6. Use a query profiler: A query profiler can help identify which parts of a query are taking the most time, allowing you to focus on optimizing those parts.

7. Use stored procedures: Using stored procedures can speed up queries by reducing network traffic and optimizing the way data is retrieved from the database.

33.  how to manage a limitation in my program that only manages 100 objects whilst having a 1000 in my database.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To manage the limitation in your program where it can only handle 100 objects while you have 1000 objects in your database, you can implement pagination or limit the result set using SQL queries. Here are two approaches you can consider:

1. **Pagination**: Implement pagination in your program to retrieve data in smaller chunks or pages. This allows you to fetch a limited number of objects at a time, based on the program's capacity. You can use the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses in your SQL queries to retrieve a specific number of records per page and navigate through the result set. By fetching data in smaller portions, you can work within the limitations of your program.

   For example, if your program can handle 100 objects at a time, you can retrieve the first 100 objects using a query like this:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 100;
   ```

   Then, when the user requests more data or navigates to the next page, you can retrieve the next 100 objects using an offset:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 100 OFFSET 100;
   ```

   By incrementing the `OFFSET` value with each subsequent page, you can retrieve the data in manageable chunks.

2. **Limiting the result set**: Alternatively, you can limit the result set directly in your SQL queries to retrieve only a specific number of objects. This ensures that your program receives a limited number of records that it can handle.

   For example, if you want to retrieve only 100 objects from your database, you can modify your query like this:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 100;
   ```

   This query will return only the first 100 objects from the table, respecting the limitation of your program.

By implementing pagination or limiting the result set, you can effectively manage the limitation in your program and work with a subset of objects from your database that fits within your program's capacity.

34.  How to find common records in two tables ?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To find common records in two tables, you can use the SQL JOIN operation to combine the tables based on a common column. Here's how you can approach it:

```sql
SELECT t1.column1, t1.column2, ...
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.common_column = t2.common_column;
```

Explanation:
In this query, `table1` and `table2` represent the names of the two tables you want to compare. You need to specify the columns you want to select from `table1` using `t1.column1`, `t1.column2`, and so on. Replace `common_column` with the actual column name that is common between the two tables.

The `JOIN` operation combines the rows from both tables based on matching values in the common column. This will return only the common records that exist in both tables.

35.   How to find min and max of a salary column?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To find the minimum and maximum values of a salary column in a table, you can use the SQL MIN() and MAX() aggregate functions. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) AS min_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM your_table;
```

Explanation:
In this query, replace `your_table` with the actual name of the table you're working with. The MIN() function returns the minimum value of the salary column, and the MAX() function returns the maximum value. The AS keyword is used to assign aliases to the result columns, `min_salary` and `max_salary`, respectively.

</details>

36.   If you had an id column like 1,2,3,4,5,... how would you return the records with odd ID's

To return the records with odd IDs from a table with an ID column, you can use the modulo operator (%) in your SQL query. Here's how you can do it:

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE id % 2 = 1;
```

Explanation:
In this MySQL query, replace `your_table` with the actual name of the table you're working with, and `id` with the actual name of the ID column. The condition `id % 2 = 1` checks if the ID value is odd. The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder when the ID is divided by 2. If the remainder is 1, it indicates an odd ID.

</details>

---

37.  How do you select top 10 employees with highest salary in table?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To select the top 10 employees with the highest salary in a table, you can use the SQL query below:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Explanation:
In this query, `employees` represents the name of the table containing employee records. The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the records based on the `salary` column in descending order. The `DESC` keyword specifies a descending sort. The `LIMIT` clause limits the result to 10 rows, giving you the top 10 employees with the highest salary.

This query will work for both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases as the syntax is the same.

38. How would you get the individual transactions and the total transaction amount over the course of a month for a customer from a Customers table and a Transactions table?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To retrieve the individual transactions and the total transaction amount over the course of a month for a customer from a Customers table and a Transactions table, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT t.transaction_id, t.transaction_date, t.amount, c.customer_name, SUM(t.amount) AS total_amount
FROM Customers c
JOIN Transactions t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
WHERE t.transaction_date >= '2023-05-01' AND t.transaction_date < '2023-06-01'
GROUP BY t.transaction_id, t.transaction_date, t.amount, c.customer_name;
```

Explanation:
In this query, `Customers` and `Transactions` represent the names of the Customers table and Transactions table, respectively. The `customer_id` is the common column that establishes the relationship between the two tables. Adjust the date range in the `WHERE` clause to match the desired month.

The query joins the Customers and Transactions tables based on the customer_id column. It selects the transaction ID, transaction date, transaction amount, and customer name. The `SUM()` function calculates the total transaction amount. The result is grouped by the individual transaction details.

This query can be used in both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases as the syntax is the same.

39.  how to delete duplicates in SQL?

<details><summary><b>MySQL</b></summary>

```sql
DELETE FROM your_table
WHERE (column1, column2, ...) IN (
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM your_table
    GROUP BY column1, column2, ...
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
```

Explanation:
In this MySQL query, replace `your_table` with the actual name of the table you're working with, and `column1, column2, ...` with the column names that define the duplicates. The subquery selects the duplicate rows by grouping them based on the specified columns and then filters only those groups that have a count greater than 1, indicating duplicates. The `DELETE` statement deletes the rows that match the conditions specified in the subquery, effectively removing the duplicates from the table.

</details>

<details><summary><b>PostgreSQL</b></summary>

```sql
DELETE FROM your_table a
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM your_table b
    WHERE a.column1 = b.column1
    AND a.column2 = b.column2
    ...
    AND a.ctid < b.ctid
);
```

Explanation:
This PostgreSQL query deletes the duplicate rows from the `your_table`. Replace `your_table` with the actual name of the table, and `column1, column2, ...` with the column names that define the duplicates. The subquery checks for the existence of rows with the same values in the specified columns, but with a lower `ctid` (the internal identifier of each row). This ensures that only duplicates are deleted, keeping one copy of each unique row.

40.  "on SQL code challenge: given two tables """"employee"""" and """"sale_details"""", ask to
-  present the employee who have sold nothing.  
-  presend the employee who is the top sales.

SQL Code Challenge: Given two tables "employee" and "sale_details", present the employee who have sold nothing.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

<details><summary><b>MySQL</b></summary>

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name
FROM employee e
LEFT JOIN sale_details sd ON e.employee_id = sd.employee_id
WHERE sd.employee_id IS NULL;
```

Explanation:
In this MySQL query, the `employee` table is joined with the `sale_details` table using a `LEFT JOIN` based on the `employee_id` column. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all employees from the `employee` table are included in the result, even if they have no corresponding rows in the `sale_details` table. The `WHERE` clause filters out the rows where `sale_details.employee_id` is `NULL`, indicating that the employee has sold nothing.

</details>

<details><summary><b>PostgreSQL</b></summary>

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name
FROM employee e
LEFT JOIN sale_details sd ON e.employee_id = sd.employee_id
WHERE sd.employee_id IS NULL;
```

Explanation:
This PostgreSQL query is similar to the MySQL version. It uses a `LEFT JOIN` to combine the `employee` and `sale_details` tables based on the `employee_id` column. The `WHERE` clause filters out the rows where `sale_details.employee_id` is `NULL`, indicating that the employee has sold nothing.

SQL Code Challenge: Given two tables "employee" and "sale_details", present the employee who is the top sales.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, SUM(sd.amount) AS total_sales
FROM employee e
JOIN sale_details sd ON e.employee_id = sd.employee_id
GROUP BY e.employee_id, e.employee_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Explanation:
This query joins the "employee" table with the "sale_details" table based on the "employee_id" column. It uses the `SUM()` function to calculate the total sales amount for each employee. The result is grouped by the employee's ID and name. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result in descending order based on the total sales amount. Finally, the `LIMIT 1` clause selects only the top row, which represents the employee with the highest sales.

Note: If there are multiple employees with the same highest sales amount, this query will return only one of them. To retrieve all employees with the highest sales, you can modify the query accordingly.

    -Employee table columns: id, name, department_name
    -Department table columns: id, department_name"

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To retrieve the department of an employee based on the employee table and department table, you can use a simple `JOIN` between the two tables. Here's the query:

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employee e
JOIN department d ON e.department_name = d.department_name
WHERE e.id = 123;
```

Explanation:
- Replace `e.name` with the column name that stores the employee's name in the employee table.
- Replace `d.department_name` with the column name that stores the department names in the department table.
- Replace `employee` with the name of your employee table.
- Replace `department` with the name of your department table.
- Replace `e.department_name` and `d.department_name` with the respective column names in both tables that represent the department names.
- Replace `e.id = 123` with the condition that matches the desired employee ID.

For example, if you have an employee table with columns `id`, `name`, and `department_name`, and a department table with columns `id` and `department_name`, and you want to retrieve the department of an employee with ID 123, the query would be:

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employee e
JOIN department d ON e.department_name = d.department_name

46.   How to do a left join

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To perform a left join in SQL, you can use the `LEFT JOIN` keyword in your query. Here's the syntax:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON join_condition;
```

Explanation:
- Replace `columns` with the columns you want to select from the tables.
- Replace `table1` and `table2` with the names of the tables you want to join.
- Replace `join_condition` with the condition that specifies how the tables should be joined.

For example, let's say you have two tables named `orders` and `customers`, and you want to retrieve all orders along with their corresponding customer information (if available) using a left join on the `customer_id` column. The query would be:

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.customer_name
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

This query selects the `order_id` and `order_date` columns from the `orders` table and the `customer_name` column from the `customers` table. It performs a left join based on the matching `customer_id` column, retrieving all orders and including the customer name if a matching customer exists.

Adjust the table names, column names, and join conditions as per your specific table structure and requirements.

47.  How do you sort data after it has been pulled from a database?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To sort data after it has been pulled from a database, you can use the `ORDER BY` clause in SQL. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM your_table
ORDER BY column1 ASC/DESC;
```

Explanation:
- Replace `column1, column2, ...` with the actual columns you want to select from the table.
- Replace `your_table` with the name of your table.
- Replace `column1` with the specific column you want to sort the data by.
- Replace `ASC` or `DESC` to specify the sorting order. `ASC` stands for ascending order (smallest to largest), and `DESC` stands for descending order (largest to smallest).

For example, if you have a table named `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`, and you want to retrieve the data sorted by `employee_id` in ascending order, the query would be:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
ORDER BY employee_id ASC;
```

This query will retrieve the data from the `employees` table and sort it based on the `employee_id` column in ascending order.

Adjust the table name, column names, and sorting criteria as per your specific table structure and requirements.

49.  Group by department and put the 1st/last name of the employees in that department in a single cell

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To group employees by department and concatenate the first and last names of employees within each department into a single cell, you can use the `GROUP_CONCAT` function along with the `GROUP BY` clause. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT department, GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)) AS employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

Explanation:
- The query selects the `department` column from the `employees` table.
- The `GROUP_CONCAT` function concatenates the `first_name` and `last_name` columns using the `CONCAT` function.
- The result of the concatenation is aliased as `employees`.
- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the rows by the `department` column.
- The query returns the department and the concatenated names of employees within each department in a single cell.

Return the 3rd highest employee salary.


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To return the 3rd highest employee salary from the `employees` and `employee_salaries` tables, you can use the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT salary
FROM employee_salaries
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```

Explanation:
- The query selects the `salary` column from the `employee_salaries` table.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the salaries in descending order, placing the highest salary first.
- The `LIMIT` clause with `1` specifies that only one row should be returned.
- The `OFFSET 2` clause skips the first two rows, effectively returning the 3rd highest salary.

Please note that this query assumes that the `employee_salaries` table contains a column named `salary` that stores the salaries of the employees.

Adjust the table names, column names, and `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` values as per your specific table structure and requirements.

51.  How to find common records in two tables


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

To find common records in two tables, you can use the `INNER JOIN` operation. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT t1.column1, t1.column2, ...
FROM table1 t1
INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.common_column = t2.common_column;
```

Explanation:
- Replace `t1.column1, t1.column2, ...` with the actual columns you want to select from `table1`.
- Replace `table1` with the name of the first table.
- Replace `table2` with the name of the second table.
- Replace `t1.common_column` and `t2.common_column` with the common column on which you want to join the two tables.

The `INNER JOIN` operation returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables based on the specified common column. This effectively gives you the common records between the two tables.

Here's an example query that demonstrates finding common records between two tables based on a common column named `id`:

```sql
SELECT t1.id, t1.name, t2.address
FROM table1 t1
INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
```

This query selects the `id`, `name`, and `address` columns from `table1` and `table2`, respectively, and returns only the rows where the `id` values match in both tables.

Adjust the column names, table names, and common column as per your specific scenario.

52.  Write a SQL query where we combine a customers table and sales table to find the most recent purchase from each customer?

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

<details><summary><b>MySQL</b></summary>

To find the most recent purchase from each customer by combining the `customers` table and the `sales` table, you can use a subquery and the `MAX` function. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, s.purchase_date, s.purchase_amount
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE s.purchase_date = (
    SELECT MAX(purchase_date)
    FROM sales
    WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id
);
```

Explanation:
- The query uses an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `customers` and `sales` tables based on the `customer_id` column.
- The subquery `(SELECT MAX(purchase_date) FROM sales WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id)` is used to find the maximum (most recent) purchase date for each customer.
- The outer query selects the relevant columns (`customer_id`, `customer_name`, `purchase_date`, `purchase_amount`) from both tables.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only the rows where the purchase date matches the most recent purchase date for each customer.

</details>

<details><summary><b>PostgreSQL</b></summary>

In PostgreSQL, you can use the `DISTINCT ON` clause along with the `ORDER BY` clause to find the most recent purchase from each customer. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (c.customer_id)
    c.customer_id, c.customer_name, s.purchase_date, s.purchase_amount
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id, s.purchase_date DESC;
```

Explanation:
- The query uses an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `customers` and `sales` tables based on the `customer_id` column.
- The `DISTINCT ON (c.customer_id)` clause ensures that only the first row with a unique `customer_id` is returned for each customer.
- The `ORDER BY` clause orders the rows first by `customer_id` and then by `purchase_date` in descending order, so the most recent purchase for each customer appears first.
- The selected columns (`customer_id`, `customer_name`, `purchase_date`, `purchase_amount`) are returned in the result.

53.  SQL queries, How to filter results and search with conditions
    

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

Filtering results and searching with conditions in SQL can be achieved using the `WHERE` clause in combination with various operators and functions. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM your_table
WHERE condition;
```

Explanation:
- Replace `column1, column2, ...` with the actual column names you want to select from the table.
- Replace `your_table` with the name of your table.
- Replace `condition` with the specific condition or set of conditions you want to apply to filter the results.

Examples of Conditions:
- Equality condition: `column = value`
- Inequality condition: `column <> value`
- Comparison operators: `<, >, <=, >=`
- Logical operators: `AND, OR, NOT`
- Pattern matching using `LIKE`: `column LIKE 'pattern'`
- Null check: `column IS NULL` or `column IS NOT NULL`
- Range condition: `column BETWEEN value1 AND value2`
- List of values: `column IN (value1, value2, ...)`

Here's an example query that demonstrates filtering results based on conditions:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Engineering' AND salary > 50000;
```

This query selects the `employee_name` and `salary` columns from the `employees` table, filtering the results to include only employees from the Engineering department with a salary greater than 50,000.

Please adjust the column names, table name, and conditions as per your specific requirements.

54.  how do you create a table/select specific things from that table created  

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

  SQL Query to Create a Table and Select Specific Data:


<details><summary><b>MySQL</b></summary>

To create a table, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` statement in MySQL. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE your_table (
    column1 datatype1,
    column2 datatype2,
    ...
);

-- Example table creation
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    address VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Select specific data from the created table
SELECT student_name, age
FROM students;
```

Explanation:
The first part of the query demonstrates how to create a table named `your_table` with the specified columns and data types. You can replace `your_table` with the desired table name and define the appropriate columns and data types according to your needs.

The second part shows an example of creating a `students` table with columns `student_id`, `student_name`, `age`, and `address`. The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint is used to define the primary key column.

After creating the table, you can use the `SELECT` statement to query and retrieve specific data from the table. In this example, the query selects the `student_name` and `age` columns from the `students` table.

Please modify the table name, column names, and data types to match your requirements.

</details>

<details><summary><b>PostgreSQL</b></summary>

To create a table and select specific data in PostgreSQL, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` statement followed by the `SELECT` statement. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE your_table (
    column1 datatype1,
    column2 datatype2,
    ...
);

-- Example table creation
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    address VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Select specific data from the created table
SELECT student_name, age
FROM students;
```

Explanation:
The first part of the query demonstrates how to create a table named `your_table` with the specified columns and data types. Replace `your_table` with the desired table name and define the appropriate columns and data types based on your requirements.

The second part shows an example of creating a `students` table with columns `student_id`, `student_name`, `age`, and `address`. The `SERIAL` data type is used for the `student_id` column, which automatically generates a unique value for each new row. The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint is applied to the `student_id` column.

After creating the table, the `SELECT` statement is used to query and retrieve specific data from the `students` table. In this example, the query selects the `student_name` and `age` columns.

Please adjust the table name, column names, and data types as per your requirements.

55. table 1: student name, student id, address, age. 
table 2: student rank, score, student id, student row. student name, student age, score, student rank < than 10


<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

SQL Query to Join Tables and Filter by Student Rank:

```sql
SELECT t1.student_name, t1.student_id, t1.address, t1.age, t2.student_rank, t2.score
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.student_id = t2.student_id
WHERE t2.student_rank < 10;
```

Explanation:
This MySQL query performs an inner join between `table1` and `table2` based on the common column `student_id`. It selects the columns `student_name`, `student_id`, `address`, `age`, `student_rank`, and `score` from both tables. The `WHERE` clause filters the result to include only those students whose `student_rank` is less than 10.

Please replace `table1` and `table2` with the actual names of your tables, and adjust the column names (`student_name`, `student_id`, `address`, `age`, `student_rank`, `score`) as per your table structure.

56.    how do you delete duplicate record with no key or timestamp.
    
<details><summary>Answer</summary>

<blockquote>

To delete duplicate records when you don't have a key or timestamp to uniquely identify them, you can use a combination of temporary tables and self-joins. Here's an example of how you can approach this:

```sql
-- Step 1: Create a temporary table with a unique identifier
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table AS
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY column1, column2) AS row_num
FROM your_table;

-- Step 2: Identify the duplicate records based on the columns that define duplication
SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM temp_table
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Step 3: Delete the duplicate records except for one occurrence
DELETE FROM your_table
WHERE (column1, column2) IN (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM temp_table
    GROUP BY column1, column2
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
) AND row_num > 1;

-- Step 4: Drop the temporary table
DROP TABLE temp_table;
```

Explanation:
1. Step 1: Create a temporary table (`temp_table`) that includes all columns from `your_table` and assigns a unique row number to each record using the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function. Adjust the `ORDER BY` clause to define the order of records based on your preference.
2. Step 2: Identify the duplicate records by grouping the records based on the columns that define duplication (`column1`, `column2`, etc.) and selecting the count of duplicates (`duplicate_count`).
3. Step 3: Delete the duplicate records from `your_table` by using a subquery with the `IN` operator. The subquery selects the duplicate records based on the same grouping criteria and excludes the first occurrence (`row_num > 1`).
4. Step 4: Finally, drop the temporary table (`temp_table`).

Note: This approach assumes that the combination of columns used for identifying duplicates is sufficient to determine uniqueness. If you have additional criteria, you can modify the `GROUP BY` clause and the conditions in the `DELETE` statement accordingly.

57. Find the Max and Min amt in columns

<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

SQL Query to Find the Maximum and Minimum Amounts in a Column:


```sql
SELECT MAX(amount) AS max_amount, MIN(amount) AS min_amount FROM your_table;
```

Explanation:
This MySQL query uses the `MAX` and `MIN` aggregate functions to calculate the maximum and minimum values, respectively, in the specified column (`amount`). The `AS` keyword is used to provide aliases `max_amount` and `min_amount` for the resulting columns, representing the maximum and minimum amounts, respectively.

Please replace `your_table` with the actual name of your table.

58.  get the amount for each month if each. 1 column for each 
month the rest are null.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>


SQL Query to Get the Amount for Each Month (with Null for Non-Matching Months):

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(transaction_date) = 1 THEN amount ELSE NULL END) AS January,
    SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(transaction_date) = 2 THEN amount ELSE NULL END) AS February,
    SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(transaction_date) = 3 THEN amount ELSE NULL END) AS March,
    -- Add more months here as needed
FROM transactions;
```

Explanation:
This MySQL query uses the `SUM` function with conditional statements (`CASE WHEN`) to calculate the sum of the `amount` column for each month. Each month is represented as a separate column in the result. The `CASE WHEN` statement checks the month of the `transaction_date` and returns the `amount` if it matches the respective month, otherwise it returns `NULL`.

- To find duplicates in a table using *SQL and PostgreSQL*, we can use the following query:

```sql

SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

- Replace column_name with the name of the column you want to check for duplicates and table_name with the name of the table containing the column.

- This query groups the rows in the table by the values in the specified column and returns only those groups that have a count greater than one. This means that only the rows that have duplicates in the specified column will be returned.

60. What is SQL command "Merge". 

<details><summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>

SQL Command "MERGE" (also known as UPSERT) is used to perform both INSERT and UPDATE operations on a target table based on a condition specified in the query. It combines the functionality of both INSERT and UPDATE statements into a single statement.
  
Let's say we have a target table named `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary`, and a source table named `employee_updates` with columns `employee_id` and `salary_updates`. We want to update the salary of employees if their records exist in the source table, otherwise, we want to insert a new record.

The MERGE statement would look like this:

```sql
MERGE INTO employees AS target
USING employee_updates AS source
ON (target.employee_id = source.employee_id)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET target.salary = source.salary_updates
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (employee_id, name, salary)
    VALUES (source.employee_id, target.name, source.salary_updates);
```

In this example, the `MERGE INTO` clause specifies the target table (`employees`) and the `USING` clause specifies the source table (`employee_updates`). The `ON` clause defines the condition for matching rows between the target and source tables.

The `WHEN MATCHED THEN` block specifies the action to be taken when a matching row is found. In this case, it performs an update on the `salary` column of the target table using the value from the `salary_updates` column of the source table.

The `WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN` block specifies the action to be taken when no matching row is found. It inserts a new record into the target table using the values from the source table.

This way, the MERGE statement allows you to handle both INSERT and UPDATE operations in a single query, based on the specified conditions.

61.  How do you get data from two separate tables in a single query?

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- To get data from two separate tables in a single query in *SQL and PostgreSQL*, you can use the JOIN clause.

- The JOIN clause allows you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of JOIN clauses, including *INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN*, each with its own specific behavior.

Here's an example of a basic INNER JOIN query:

```sql

SELECT *
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

- In this query, table1 and table2 are the names of the two tables you want to join. column is the name of the related column between the two tables that you want to use to match up rows.

- Replace the * with the column names that you want to select from the combined table.

- For example, if you have two tables named customers and orders with a related column named customer_id, and you want to get a list of all customers and their corresponding orders, you would use the following query:

```sql

SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.first_name, customers.last_name, orders.order_id, orders.order_date
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

This query will return the customer ID, first name, last name, order ID, and order date for all customers who have placed an order.

62. How do you create a sub-query in SQL and PostgreSQL?

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- To create a subquery in SQL and PostgreSQL, you can use a query nested inside another query. The result of the inner query is used as input to the outer query.

- Here's the basic syntax for creating a subquery:

```sql

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE columnN IN (SELECT columnN FROM table2 WHERE condition);
```

- In this example, the subquery is enclosed in parentheses and is executed first. The result of the subquery is then used in the outer query to filter the results.

- Here's an example of a subquery in SQL and PostgreSQL that selects the names of customers who have placed an order:

```sql

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id
  FROM orders
);
```
- In this example, the inner query selects the customer_id from the orders table. The outer query then uses the customer_id to select the corresponding first_name and last_name from the customers table.

63. How to get all contacts associated with an account where the account name contains the word 'public' assuming tables 'accounts' and 'contacts' with a corresponding column named 'account_id' in the 'contacts' table?

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Assuming we have a table named accounts and a table named contacts, and there is a column named account_id in the contacts table that corresponds to the id column in the accounts table, we can use the following query in SQL and PostgreSQL to retrieve all contacts associated with an account where the account name contains the word "public":

```sql

SELECT contacts.*
FROM contacts
INNER JOIN accounts
ON contacts.account_id = accounts.id
WHERE accounts.name LIKE '%public%';
```

- In this query, the INNER JOIN clause is used to combine the contacts and accounts tables based on their corresponding columns (contacts.account_id and accounts.id). The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the results to only include rows where the accounts.name column contains the word "public". The `SELECT` clause selects all columns from the contacts table for the resulting rows.

  FROM employees
  WHERE salary < (
    SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees

Yes, the SQL query you provided will run assuming the following:

- The table name 'table' exists in your database.
- Column 'a' and 'b' exist in 'table'.
- Column '2' refers to the second column 'column b' in the select list.
- The query will select the values from 'column a' and 'column b' from the table 'table' and order the results by the second column in the select list, which is 'column b'. So, the output of the query will be a list of values from 'column a' and 'column b', ordered by the values in 'column b'.

<blockquote>

We can extract just the last name from the "name" field in SQL and PostgreSQL using string manipulation functions:

```sql

SELECT SUBSTRING(name, CHARINDEX(' ', name) + 1) AS last_name FROM table;
```

This query uses the CHARINDEX function to find the position of the first space character in the "name" field, and then uses the SUBSTRING function to extract the substring starting from the position of the space character + 1 (which is the first character of the last name).

*PostgreSQL*:

```sql

SELECT SPLIT_PART(name, ' ', 2) AS last_name FROM table;
```
This query uses the SPLIT_PART function to split the "name" field into two parts based on the space separator, and then selects the second part (which is the last name).

72. How would you account for having multiple showings of the same movie at the same time? 

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- If you have multiple showings of the same movie at the same time, you can account for it in your *SQL and PostgreSQL* database by adding a unique identifier for each showing. One way to do this is to create a composite primary key for the showings table that includes both the movie ID and the showing time.

- Here's an example schema for a showings table that accounts for multiple showings of the same movie at the same time:

```sql

CREATE TABLE showings (
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    movie_id INT NOT NULL,
    showing_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    theater_id INT NOT NULL
);
```

- In this example schema, the showings table has an additional "id" column that serves as a primary key to uniquely identify each showing, even if multiple showings have the same movie ID and showing time. The movie ID, showing time, and theater ID columns are included to specify which movie is being shown, when and where it's being shown.

- When inserting data into the showings table, you would need to ensure that each showing has a unique combination of movie ID, showing time, and theater ID, and that the "id" column is assigned a unique value for each new showing.

74. Show us how you'd write CREATE TABLE statements to set up SQL tables to store the street addresses of multiple people (there can be multiple people at the same address). Write a query to select all people living in a specific city from the tables you created

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Here's an example of how to write CREATE TABLE statements to set up SQL tables to store the street addresses of multiple people. This query works for both *SQL and PostgreSQL*:

```sql

CREATE TABLE addresses (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    street VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    state VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL,
    zip_code VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE people (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (address_id) REFERENCES addresses(id)
);
```

- In this example, the "addresses" table includes columns for the street, city, state, and ZIP code, while the "people" table includes a foreign key column referencing the "id" column of the "addresses" table to associate each person with a specific address.

- Here's an example query to select all people living in a specific city:

```sql

SELECT people.name, addresses.street, addresses.city, addresses.state, addresses.zip_code
FROM people
INNER JOIN addresses ON people.address_id = addresses.id
WHERE addresses.city = 'New York';
```

- This query uses an INNER JOIN to join the "people" and "addresses" tables based on the "address_id" foreign key column, and then uses a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include people living in the specified city (in this case, "New York"). The SELECT clause is used to select the relevant columns from both tables for display in the query result.

WHERE 1 = 2;
```

- In this statement, new_table_name is the name you want to give to the new table, and existing_table_name is the name of the existing table whose structure you want to copy.

- The SELECT statement retrieves the column structure of the existing table, but the WHERE clause always evaluates to false, so no data is actually selected. This means that the new table will have the same columns as the existing table, but it will be empty.

78. How to count the number of s's in the string Infosys in SQL?

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- In both *SQL and PostgreSQL*, you can use the `LEN() or LENGTH()` function along with the `REPLACE()` function to count the number of occurrences of a specific character in a string.

For example, to count the number of "s"s in the string "Infosys", you can use the following SQL query:

```SQL

SELECT LEN('Infosys') - LEN(REPLACE('Infosys', 's', '')) AS num_of_s;
```

- In PostgreSQL, you can use the LENGTH() function instead of LEN():

```SQL

SELECT LENGTH('Infosys') - LENGTH(REPLACE('Infosys', 's', '')) AS num_of_s;
```
