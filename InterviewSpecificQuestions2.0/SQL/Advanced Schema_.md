<blockquote>

Multiplicity is also known as cardinality defines the number of instances that can be associated between two entities. Here are the different types of multiplicity relationships:

- **One-to-One (1:1):** Each instance of one entity is associated with exactly one instance of another entity, and vice versa.

- **One-to-Many (1:N):** Each instance of one entity is associated with multiple instances of another entity, but each instance of the other entity is associated with only one instance of the first entity.

- **Many-to-One (N:1):** Multiple instances of one entity are associated with a single instance of another entity.

- **Many-to-Many (N:N):** Multiple instances of one entity can be associated with multiple instances of another entity through a junction table.
