<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used for interacting with databases, primarily for querying and manipulating data.
- PL/SQL, on the other hand, is a procedural language that extends SQL to include procedural constructs like loops, conditions, and exception handling. 
- PL/SQL allows you to write blocks of code for executing complex logic and implementing business rules within the database.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
PL/SQL supports three types of blocks:
**Anonymous blocks:** Unnamed blocks of code that can be executed directly.
**Named blocks:** Blocks of code defined using a name and can be stored in the database for reuse.
**Subprograms:**  Named blocks of code that can be called from other PL/SQL blocks. Subprograms include procedures, functions, and packages.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

 Cursors in PL/SQL allow you to retrieve and process multiple rows from a result set. There are two types of cursors:
-  implicit cursors (handled automatically by PL/SQL for queries) and
- explicit cursors (manually declared and used for more control).

6. Explain the Types of Cursors?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

-There are two types of cursors:

**Implicit Cursor:** When PL/SQL executes an SQL statement, it automatically constructs a cursor without specifying one; these cursors are known as implicit PL/SQL uses implicit cursors for the following statements:
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- SELECT

**Explicit Cursor:** A programmer declares and names an explicit cursor for the queries that return more than one row. An explicit cursor is a SELECT statement that is declared explicitly in the current blockâ€™s declaration section or in a package definition. The following are the commands that are used for explicit cursors in PL/SQL:
- OPEN
- FETCH
- CLOSE
