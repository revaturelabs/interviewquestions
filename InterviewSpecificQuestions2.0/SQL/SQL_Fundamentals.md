<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing relational databases. There are several sub-languages of SQL, each with its own syntax and purpose. 

- Data Definition Language (DDL): DDL is used to define and modify the structure of a database. It includes commands such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, which are used to create, modify, and delete tables, views, indexes, and other database objects.

- Data Manipulation Language (DML): DML is used to manipulate the data stored in a database. It includes commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, which are used to retrieve, add, modify, and remove data from tables.

- Data Query Language (DQL):  DQL is used to retrieve data from a database. DQL is a subset of the larger Data Manipulation Language (DML) and includes commands such as SELECT, which is used to query data from one or more tables in a database.

- Data Control Language (DCL): DCL is used to control access to a database. It includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE, which are used to grant and revoke privileges to users and roles.

- Transaction Control Language (TCL): TCL is used to manage transactions in a database. It includes commands such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT, which are used to commit or rollback changes made to a database.

2. What is an Alias?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- In SQL, an alias is a temporary name assigned to a table or column in a query. Aliases can be used to make column names more meaningful or to distinguish between multiple tables with similar names.

- Aliases are created using the AS keyword, which is optional. Here's an example of creating an alias for a table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees AS emp;
```
In this example, the table "employees" is given the alias "emp". From this point forward in the query, the table can be referred to as "emp" instead of "employees". This can make the query more readable and easier to understand.

- Aliases can also be used for columns. Here's an example:
```sql
SELECT first_name AS "First", last_name AS "Last" FROM employees;
```
In this example, the column "first_name" is given the alias "First", and the column "last_name" is given the alias "Last". This can be useful for making the column names more descriptive or easier to read.

- Aliases are a powerful feature in SQL that can be used to make queries more readable and easier to understand.

3. What is a record type?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- In SQL, a record type is a user-defined data type that represents a collection of related values. A record type is similar to a struct in other programming languages, and it allows you to define a custom data structure with its own fields and data types.

To define a record type in SQL, you use the CREATE TYPE statement. Here's an example:
```sql
CREATE TYPE person_type AS (
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```
In this example, we define a record type called "person_type" with three fields: "first_name", "last_name", and "email". Each field has its own data type, which is specified after the field name.

- Once you have defined a record type, you can use it as a data type for columns in tables or as a return type for stored procedures and functions. Here's an example of using the "person_type" record type as a column type:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name person_type
);
```
In this example, we define a table called "employees" with two columns: "id" and "name". The "name" column is of type "person_type", which means it can store values with the same structure as the "person_type" record type we defined earlier.

- Record types are a powerful feature in SQL that allow you to define custom data structures and make your database schema more expressive and easier to understand.

4. what is replace and rank function in SQL?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- In SQL, the REPLACE function is used to replace all occurrences of a substring within a string with a new substring. The basic syntax for the REPLACE function is:
```sql
REPLACE(string, old_substring, new_substring)
```
Here, "string" is the original string that you want to modify, "old_substring" is the substring that you want to replace, and "new_substring" is the substring that you want to replace it with.

For example, if you have a string "Hello, world!" and you want to replace the comma with a space, you can use the following query:
```sql
SELECT REPLACE('Hello, world!', ',', ' ');
```
This will return the string "Hello world!" with the comma replaced by a space.

- The RANK function in SQL is used to assign a rank to each row within a result set based on the values in one or more columns. The basic syntax for the RANK function is:
```sql
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column1 [ASC/DESC], column2 [ASC/DESC], ...)
```
Here, "column1", "column2", etc. are the columns that you want to use for sorting the rows. You can specify multiple columns separated by commas, and you can specify the sort order (ascending or descending) for each column.

For example, if you have a table "employees" with columns "name" and "salary", and you want to assign a rank to each employee based on their salary, you can use the following query:
```sql
SELECT name, salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```
This will return a result set with the employee name, salary, and rank, where the rank is assigned based on the salary in descending order. The employee with the highest salary will have a rank of 1, the employee with the second-highest salary will have a rank of 2, and so on.

5. List some Constraints used in SQL?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- In SQL, a constraint is a rule that is defined on a table column or a group of columns to limit the type of data that can be inserted or updated in the table. Constraints help ensure data integrity and consistency by preventing invalid data from being stored in the table. Here are some common types of constraints in SQL:

- NOT NULL constraint: This constraint ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values. When a NOT NULL constraint is defined on a column, it means that every row in the table must have a value for that column.

- UNIQUE constraint: This constraint ensures that each value in a column or a group of columns is unique. When a UNIQUE constraint is defined on a column, it means that no two rows in the table can have the same value for that column.

- PRIMARY KEY constraint: This constraint is a combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints, and it ensures that each row in the table has a unique identifier. When a PRIMARY KEY constraint is defined on one or more columns, those columns become the primary key of the table.

- FOREIGN KEY constraint: This constraint ensures that a value in a column or a group of columns matches the value in another table's primary key or unique column. When a FOREIGN KEY constraint is defined on a column, it means that the values in that column must exist in the primary key or unique column of another table.

- CHECK constraint: This constraint ensures that the values in a column meet a certain condition. When a CHECK constraint is defined on a column, it means that the values in that column must meet the condition specified in the constraint.

- DEFAULT constraint: This constraint specifies a default value for a column if no value is provided during an insert operation. When a DEFAULT constraint is defined on a column, it means that if a value is not provided for that column during an insert operation, the default value will be used.

Constraints are an essential feature in SQL that helps maintain the quality and consistency of data in a database. By enforcing rules on the data, constraints ensure that the data is accurate and reliable, and it can be used effectively for various purposes.

6. What is the difference between Primary Key and Unique Key?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>
Both primary key and unique key are used to ensure the uniqueness of values in a column or a group of columns in a table. However, there are some differences between the two:

- Primary key: A primary key is a column or a group of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It is used to enforce the integrity of the data and to ensure that each row has a unique identifier. A primary key can be defined on one or more columns, and it cannot contain NULL values. Each table can have only one primary key.

- Unique key: A unique key is a column or a group of columns that must contain unique values. It is used to ensure that no two rows in a table have the same values in the specified column(s). A unique key can be defined on one or more columns, and it can contain NULL values. Each table can have multiple unique keys.

Some key differences between primary key and unique key are:

- Primary keys are used to uniquely identify each row in a table, while unique keys are used to ensure that each row has unique values in the specified column(s).

- A primary key cannot contain NULL values, while a unique key can.

- Each table can have only one primary key, while it can have multiple unique keys.

- A foreign key in another table can reference a primary key in the current table, while a foreign key can reference a unique key as well.

Both primary key and unique key are used to ensure the uniqueness of values in a table, but primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table, while unique key is used to ensure unique values in a column or a group of columns.

<blockquote>

DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a set of SQL statements used to define, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints. DDL statements are used to create the database schema, which defines the structure and layout of the database.

Some common DDL statements in SQL include:

- CREATE: This statement is used to create a new database object such as a table, index, or view.

- ALTER: This statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object such as a table, index, or view.

- DROP: This statement is used to delete an existing database object such as a table, index, or view.

- TRUNCATE: This statement is used to delete all the rows from a table, but the table structure remains intact.

DDL statements are used by database administrators and developers to define the structure of a database and to manage database objects. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and consistency of the database, as they define the rules that govern the data stored in the database.

10. How to create a table in SQL?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- To create a new table in SQL, you can use the CREATE TABLE statement followed by the table name and the column definitions. Here's the basic syntax:
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column1 datatype constraint,
   column2 datatype constraint,
   ...
);
```
where table_name is the name of the table you want to create, column1, column2, etc. are the column names, datatype is the data type of the column, and constraint is an optional constraint that can be added to the column.

For example, if you want to create a table named "employees" with columns for employee ID, name, age, and department, you can use the following SQL statement:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
   emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   age INT,
   department VARCHAR(50)
);
```
This will create a new table "employees" with four columns: "emp_id", "name", "age", and "department". The "emp_id" column is defined as the primary key, while the "name" column is defined as not null, which means it cannot be left blank.

You can also add other constraints such as UNIQUE, CHECK, and FOREIGN KEY to the columns as required. Once the table is created, you can insert data into it using the INSERT INTO statement.

11. How to change the data type for an attribute in a table ?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

To change the data type of an attribute in a table, you can use the ALTER TABLE statement with the MODIFY keyword. Here's the basic syntax:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY column_name new_data_type;
```
where table_name is the name of the table, column_name is the name of the column whose data type you want to change, and new_data_type is the new data type for the column.

For example, if you want to change the data type of the "age" column in the "employees" table from INT to FLOAT, you can use the following SQL statement:
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
MODIFY age FLOAT;
```
This will change the data type of the "age" column to FLOAT in the "employees" table.

Note that when you change the data type of a column, you may also need to update the values in that column to match the new data type. For example, if you change a column from INT to VARCHAR, you will need to make sure that all values in that column are converted to strings. Also, if the column you're modifying is used in any indexes or constraints, you may need to modify those as well.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP are all SQL commands used to remove data or objects from a database, but they differ in their scope and level of impact.

- DELETE is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command that removes rows of data from a table. It is used to selectively remove specific rows of data based on a condition specified in the WHERE clause. DELETE only removes data from the table and does not remove the table itself.

- TRUNCATE is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command that removes all rows from a table, but does not remove the table structure. TRUNCATE is much faster than DELETE because it does not need to log the individual row deletions, but it also cannot be rolled back once it is executed. TRUNCATE also resets the identity seed value for the table, so any subsequent inserts will start with the initial value.

- DROP is a DDL command that removes a table or other database object from the database. When a table is dropped, all data, indexes, and constraints associated with the table are also removed. DROP is a very powerful command and should be used with caution, as it can lead to data loss if used incorrectly.

- In summary, DELETE is used to remove individual rows of data based on a condition, TRUNCATE is used to remove all rows from a table, and DROP is used to remove a table or other database object entirely. The level of impact and scope of each command should be considered carefully before using it in a production environment.

14. Will a sql database throw an exception?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- Yes, a SQL database can throw exceptions or errors when there is an issue with executing a SQL statement.

- For example, if you try to insert a row into a table with a primary key value that already exists, the database will throw a primary key violation error. Similarly, if you try to create a table with a column name that already exists in another table, the database will throw a column name conflict error.

- In addition to syntax errors, databases can also throw exceptions for various reasons such as constraints violations, transaction failures, deadlocks, and other issues.

- It's important to handle these exceptions properly in your application code to ensure that your application can recover from errors gracefully and provide a good user experience.

15. Differentiate between SQL vs noSQL ?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different approaches to storing and retrieving data.

- SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schemas, where data is structured into rows and columns. SQL databases are best suited for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and data integrity. SQL databases use the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) model to ensure data consistency and reliability. Popular examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

- NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in flexible, unstructured formats such as documents, key-value pairs, and graphs. NoSQL databases are best suited for applications that require scalability, high availability, and fast, real-time data processing. NoSQL databases typically do not enforce a fixed schema, which makes them highly flexible and adaptable to changing data requirements. However, this flexibility can also make it harder to ensure data consistency and reliability. Popular examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB.

- The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific needs and requirements of your application. SQL databases are typically better suited for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and data integrity, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require scalability, high availability, and real-time data processing. However, there are also hybrid databases that combine SQL and NoSQL features, offering the best of both worlds.

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- In SQL, the terms "global" and "local" tables are not commonly used. However, there are concepts of global temporary tables and local temporary tables, which are specific to certain SQL implementations such as Oracle and SQL Server.

- Global temporary tables are tables that are created once and shared across all users and sessions. They are typically used for temporary data storage and are automatically dropped at the end of the session or transaction. Global temporary tables can be accessed by any user or session, and their contents are visible to all sessions.

- Local temporary tables, on the other hand, are tables that are created and accessed only within the context of a single session. They are typically used for temporary data storage within a particular session or transaction and are automatically dropped when the session or transaction ends. Local temporary tables are visible only within the session that created them, and their contents are not visible to other sessions or users.

- The choice between global and local temporary tables depends on the specific needs and requirements of your application. Global temporary tables are useful for scenarios where multiple sessions or users need to share temporary data, while local temporary tables are useful for scenarios where temporary data is needed within a single session or transaction.

20. What are parallel queries in sql?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

- Parallel queries in SQL are a feature that allows multiple processors or cores to work together to process a single SQL query in parallel, thereby reducing the query execution time. In other words, it enables the database to divide a single query into smaller parts that can be executed simultaneously on multiple processors, rather than executing the query sequentially on a single processor.

- This feature is particularly useful for large, complex queries that involve multiple tables, joins, and aggregations, as it can significantly reduce the time it takes to process the query and return the results.

- Parallel queries are supported by many relational database management systems, including Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. However, not all queries can benefit from parallel execution, and the performance gain achieved by parallel queries depends on several factors, including the complexity of the query, the hardware configuration, and the workload on the database server.

Ranking functions in SQL are a set of built-in functions that assign a rank or row number to each row in a result set based on certain criteria, such as the value of a specific column. These functions can be used to calculate rankings, percentiles, and other statistical measures in SQL queries.

There are several types of ranking functions in SQL, including:

- RANK: assigns a unique rank to each row within a result set, with ties receiving the same rank value.

- DENSE_RANK: assigns a unique rank to each row within a result set, with ties receiving the same rank value, but no gaps between ranks.

- ROW_NUMBER: assigns a unique row number to each row within a result set, with no regard for ties.

- NTILE: divides a result set into a specified number of groups, assigning a rank to each row based on which group it belongs to.

Ranking functions are commonly used in business intelligence and data analysis applications to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in large data sets. They can also be used to sort and filter data based on specific criteria, such as the top 10% of sales by region or the lowest 5% of customer satisfaction scores.

22. What is a primary key in SQL ?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>


In SQL, a primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. The primary key constraint is used to enforce this uniqueness requirement and ensure that the data in the table is consistent and correct.

The primary key serves as a reference point for other tables in the database to establish relationships between tables. For example, in a sales database, the primary key in the customer table could be used as a foreign key in the sales order table to link each order to a specific customer.

Some key characteristics of a primary key in SQL include:

- It must contain unique values for each row in the table.
- It cannot contain null values.
- It should be composed of one or more columns that have an appropriate data type, such as integer or character.
Creating a primary key in SQL involves specifying the PRIMARY KEY constraint when creating a table or altering an existing table. A table can have only one primary key, but it can be composed of multiple columns if necessary.

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

In SQL, you can create a primary key constraint on a column or a set of columns when you create a table or alter an existing table. Here are the steps to create a primary key in SQL:

- When creating a new table, include a column or a set of columns that uniquely identify each row in the table.

For example, if you are creating a table for customers, you might include a column for the customer ID that is unique for each customer:
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);
```
- If you already have a table, you can alter the table to add a primary key constraint using the ALTER TABLE statement.

For example, if you have a table called orders and you want to add a primary key constraint on the order ID column, you can use the following statement:
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_orders PRIMARY KEY (order_id);
```
This will add a primary key constraint to the order_id column in the orders table.

When you create a foreign key, it creates a constraint that ensures data integrity and consistency between the two tables. The foreign key constraint ensures that any value in the foreign key column of the referencing table must exist in the primary key or unique key column of the referenced table.

Here are the steps to create a foreign key in SQL:

- Create the referenced table and define a primary key or a unique key constraint on the column(s) that you want to reference.

For example, if you have a table called products and you want to reference the product_id column in another table, you can create the products table with a primary key on the product_id column:
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```
- Create the referencing table and include a foreign key column that refers to the primary key or unique key of the referenced table.

For example, if you have a table called orders and you want to reference the product_id column in the products table, you can create the orders table with a foreign key on the product_id column:
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (product_id)
);
```
This will create a foreign key constraint on the product_id column in the orders table that references the product_id column in the products table. The foreign key constraint ensures that any value in the product_id column of the orders table must exist in the product_id column of the products table.

26. What are CRUD operations?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It's a set of basic operations that can be performed on data in a database or other data storage systems. These operations are fundamental to the management of data in most software applications.

Here's what each operation does:

- Create: This operation creates new data and stores it in the database. For example, creating a new user account in a social media application.
- Read: This operation retrieves data from the database. For example, reading a user's profile information from a social media application.
- Update: This operation modifies existing data in the database. For example, updating a user's profile picture in a social media application.
- Delete: This operation removes data from the database. For example, deleting a user account from a social media application.

Together, these four operations provide the basic functionality needed to manage data in most software applications

27. What is LIKE operator used for?


![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

The LIKE operator is used in SQL (Structured Query Language) to search for a pattern within a string column of a table.

It's used in the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement to filter the results based on a pattern match. The pattern can include wildcard characters to match any number of characters or a specific character.

Here's an example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE 'Sm%';
```
This SQL statement retrieves all rows from the "employees" table where the "last_name" column starts with the letters "Sm".

The % symbol is a wildcard character that matches any number of characters in the pattern. So, in this case, the query would return any employee with a last name that starts with "Sm", such as "Smith", "Smythe", or "Smeaton".

The LIKE operator is useful for searching for data that matches a specific pattern, such as email addresses, phone numbers, or names that follow a certain format.

28. what is Parent-child relationship SQL?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

In SQL, a parent-child relationship refers to a type of relationship between two tables, where one table is the parent and the other table is the child. The parent table is usually the table that contains the primary key, and the child table is the table that contains a foreign key that references the primary key in the parent table.

Here's an example of how to create a parent-child relationship between two tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
  order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  quantity INT,
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);
```
In this example, the "orders" table is the parent table, and the "order_items" table is the child table. The "orders" table contains the primary key "order_id", and the "order_items" table contains a foreign key "order_id" that references the primary key in the "orders" table.

This relationship means that each order can have multiple items, and each item belongs to a single order. The foreign key constraint ensures that an order item can only be associated with an existing order.

29. how would you establish the relationship between employee and department tables?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

To establish a relationship between an "employee" table and a "department" table in SQL, you can use a foreign key constraint.

Here's an example of how to create the two tables and establish the relationship:

```sql
CREATE TABLE department (
  department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employee (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_name VARCHAR(50),
  department_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department(department_id)
);
```
In this example, the "department" table is the parent table, and the "employee" table is the child table. The "department" table contains the primary key "department_id", and the "employee" table contains a foreign key "department_id" that references the primary key in the "department" table.

This relationship means that each employee belongs to a single department, and each department can have multiple employees. The foreign key constraint ensures that an employee can only be associated with an existing department.

30. What is the substring function used for?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

The SUBSTRING function in SQL is used to extract a substring from a string value. The function takes three arguments: the input string, the starting position, and the length of the substring.

Here's the syntax of the SUBSTRING function:
```sql
SUBSTRING(input_string, start_position, length)
```
The first argument is the input string from which the substring will be extracted. The second argument is the starting position of the substring within the input string. The third argument is the length of the substring.

Here's an example of using the SUBSTRING function to extract a substring from a string value:
```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello World', 1, 5);
```
This SQL statement retrieves the substring "Hello" from the input string "Hello World". The start_position argument is 1, which means the substring will start at the first character of the input string. The length argument is 5, which means the substring will contain the first five characters of the input string.

The SUBSTRING function is useful for extracting parts of a string, such as a person's first name from a full name or a year from a date value. It's commonly used in combination with other string functions and operators to manipulate and analyze string data in SQL.

31. Talk about transaction control language and its advantages

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Transaction Control Language (TCL) is a set of SQL statements that are used to control transactions in a relational database. The three main TCL commands are COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

The advantages of TCL are:

- Data Consistency: TCL commands ensure data consistency in the database. A transaction may contain multiple queries that modify the data in the database. If any of the queries fail to execute, the entire transaction is rolled back to its original state. This helps to maintain the integrity of the data.

- Atomicity: Atomicity is one of the ACID properties of a database. It ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is returned to its original state. This ensures that the database remains consistent and that data is not lost or corrupted.

- Recovery: TCL commands help to recover data in the event of a system failure or unexpected shutdown. When a transaction is committed, the changes made by the transaction are written to the database's transaction log. If the system crashes, the database can use the transaction log to recover any changes that were not written to disk before the failure occurred.

- Concurrency Control: TCL commands help to manage concurrency in a database. Multiple users may be accessing the same data at the same time, and TCL commands ensure that transactions do not interfere with each other. When a transaction is executed, a lock is placed on the data that it accesses. This lock prevents other transactions from modifying the same data until the first transaction is committed or rolled back.

In summary, TCL provides a robust mechanism for managing transactions in a database. It ensures data consistency, atomicity, recovery, and concurrency control, which are critical to maintaining the integrity of the database and its data.

32. What is the use of COMMIT in SQL?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

In SQL, COMMIT is a command that is used to permanently save the changes made to a database by a transaction. When a transaction is executed in a database, the changes made by the transaction are not saved until the transaction is committed. COMMIT is the command that signals the end of a transaction and makes its changes permanent in the database.

Here's an example of how to use the COMMIT command:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE customers SET email = 'newemail@example.com' WHERE customer_id = 1;
COMMIT;
```
In this example, a transaction is started using the BEGIN TRANSACTION command. The UPDATE statement modifies the email address of a customer with ID 1. Finally, the COMMIT command is used to permanently save the changes made by the transaction.

It's important to note that once a transaction is committed, its changes cannot be undone. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that a transaction is properly executed and tested before committing it. If a transaction needs to be rolled back, the ROLLBACK command can be used to cancel the transaction and undo its changes.

33. What is the difference between Commit, save point, and Rollback in Oracle?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

COMMIT, SAVEPOINT, and ROLLBACK are all Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands that are used to manage transactions in a relational database. Here's a brief overview of each command and their differences:

- COMMIT: The COMMIT command is used to permanently save the changes made by a transaction. When a transaction is committed, its changes are made permanent in the database. Once a transaction is committed, its changes cannot be undone.

- SAVEPOINT: The SAVEPOINT command is used to create a point in a transaction where it can be rolled back to if necessary. A SAVEPOINT is like a bookmark within a transaction. If a transaction encounters an error, it can be rolled back to the last SAVEPOINT created, rather than rolling back the entire transaction.

- ROLLBACK: The ROLLBACK command is used to undo changes made by a transaction. When a transaction is rolled back, all the changes made by the transaction are undone, and the database is returned to its previous state. A transaction can be rolled back in full or to a specific SAVEPOINT created during the transaction.

In summary, COMMIT is used to permanently save changes made by a transaction, ROLLBACK is used to undo changes made by a transaction, and SAVEPOINT is used to create a point in a transaction where it can be rolled back to if necessary. While all three commands are used to manage transactions in Oracle, they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

34. What is the syntax for UPDATE in SQL?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

The UPDATE statement is used in SQL to modify existing records in a database table. Here is the syntax for the UPDATE statement in SQL:
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
Let's break down the syntax:

- UPDATE: This keyword tells the database to update existing records.
- table_name: This is the name of the table that you want to update.
- SET: This keyword indicates that you are going to set new values for one or more columns in the table.
- column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...: This specifies the new values that you want to set for one or more columns in the table. Each column and its new value are separated by a comma.
- WHERE: This keyword is used to filter the records that you want to update. The condition specified after the WHERE keyword determines which records will be updated.
- condition: This specifies the condition that must be met for a record to be updated. If the condition is not met, the record will not be updated.
Here is an example of an UPDATE statement that sets a new value for the "price" column in a "products" table for all products with a "product_id" greater than or equal to 100:
```sql
UPDATE products
SET price = 19.99
WHERE product_id >= 100;
```
This statement sets the "price" column to 19.99 for all products with a "product_id" greater than or equal to 100. It's important to note that the WHERE clause is used to filter the records that are updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated.

35. What is SQL window functions?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

In SQL, window functions are used to perform calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row. These calculations are performed on a "window" of rows that are defined by a specific set of criteria, rather than on the entire table. Window functions are particularly useful for performing complex calculations on subsets of data, such as finding running totals, calculating moving averages, or ranking results.

Window functions are used in combination with the OVER clause, which defines the window or set of rows that the calculation will be performed on. The syntax for a window function is as follows:
```sql
function_name(expression) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
    [ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ... ]
    [ROWS/RANGE BETWEEN window_specification]
)
```
Here's a brief explanation of each part of the syntax:

- function_name: This is the name of the window function that you want to use, such as SUM, AVG, RANK, or ROW_NUMBER.
- expression: This is the column or expression that you want to perform the calculation on.
- PARTITION BY: This is an optional clause that partitions the result set into smaller groups based on the values of one or more columns. The calculation is performed separately for each group.
- ORDER BY: This is an optional clause that specifies the order in which the rows are processed. The calculation is performed in the order specified by this clause.
- ROWS/RANGE BETWEEN: This is an optional clause that defines the window or set of rows that the calculation will be performed on. The window can be defined as a set of rows relative to the current row, or as a range of values based on the order specified by the ORDER BY clause.
Here's an example of a window function that calculates the running total of a "sales" column in a "sales_data" table partitioned by a "region" column and ordered by a "date" column:
```sql
SELECT region, date, sales,
       SUM(sales) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY date) as running_total
FROM sales_data;
```
This query uses the SUM window function to calculate the running total of the "sales" column for each region, ordered by date. The result set includes the original "region", "date", and "sales" columns, as well as a new "running_total" column that contains the result of the window function.

36. What is composition in SQL?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>
In SQL, composition refers to the ability to combine multiple SQL queries to form a more complex query. This is typically achieved using the keywords "UNION", "INTERSECT", and "EXCEPT".

- UNION: This keyword is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. The SELECT statements must return the same number of columns and compatible data types.

- INTERSECT: This keyword is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements and return only the rows that are common to all the SELECT statements. Again, the SELECT statements must return the same number of columns and compatible data types.

- EXCEPT: This keyword is used to combine the results of two SELECT statements and return only the rows that are unique to the first SELECT statement and not present in the second SELECT statement. Once again, the SELECT statements must return the same number of columns and compatible data types.

By using these keywords in combination with parentheses, SQL allows you to create complex queries that can perform more sophisticated data analysis.

37. How would you delete duplicate record in a database?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>
To delete duplicate information in a database, you can use the DELETE statement in combination with a subquery that selects the duplicate rows. Here is a general approach to delete duplicate information from a table:

- Identify the columns that determine whether a row is a duplicate. For example, if you have a table of customers, you might consider the columns "first_name", "last_name", and "email" to determine whether two rows represent the same customer.

- Use a subquery to select the duplicate rows. The subquery should return the primary key values of the rows that you want to delete. For example, if your customers table has a primary key column named "id", you can use a subquery like this:
```sql
SELECT MIN(id) as id_to_keep
FROM customers
GROUP BY first_name, last_name, email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```
This subquery selects the minimum value of the "id" column for each set of duplicate rows, based on the "first_name", "last_name", and "email" columns.

- Use the selected primary key values to delete the duplicate rows from the table. You can use a DELETE statement with a WHERE clause that matches the primary key values returned by the subquery. For example:
```sql
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id) as id_to_keep
    FROM customers
    GROUP BY first_name, last_name, email
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
```
This statement deletes all rows from the "customers" table whose "id" value is not in the set of primary key values selected by the subquery.

Note that you should always back up your data before deleting any rows from a table, and carefully review the results of the subquery before executing the DELETE statement to ensure that you are deleting the correct rows.
