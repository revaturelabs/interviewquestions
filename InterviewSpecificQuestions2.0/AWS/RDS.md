<details>
<summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) deployment is a high-availability feature in Amazon RDS. When Multi-AZ is enabled, a standby replica of your database instance is automatically created in a different Availability Zone. In the event of a primary database failure, RDS automatically fails over to the standby replica, minimizing downtime.
