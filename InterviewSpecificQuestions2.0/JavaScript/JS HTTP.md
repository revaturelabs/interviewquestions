5. Differentiate between Local storage & Session storage?

 ![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<blockquote>

`Local Storage` – The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request , which will reduce the amount of traffic between client and server. 

`Session Storage` – The data stored in local storage has no expiration time, data stored in session storage gets cleared when the page session ends. Which will leave when the browser is closed.
