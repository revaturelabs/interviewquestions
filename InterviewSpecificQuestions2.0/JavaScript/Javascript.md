5. Explain about the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>


The scope of a variable represents where the variable has been declared or defined in a JavaScript program. There are two scopes of a variable:

`Global Scope` -Global variables, having global scope are available everywhere in a JavaScript code.

`Local Scope` -The Local Scope has divided into the Function scope, the Block scope, and the Lexical scope.
  - `Function Scope` -The variable declared in a function is only visible inside that function.
  - `Block Scope` -Block scope is the scope of the variables declared inside the {} (curly brackets).
  - `Lexical Scope` -Lexical scope is that a variable defined outside a function can access the inside another function defined after the variable declaration. The inner functions are lexically bound to the execution context of their outer functions.

6. Differentiate between the terms undefined and not defined.

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

``` java
var x;
console.log(x);
```

Here in the example, we will get a message x is `undefined` which means the variable x is declared and memory is created but the value is not assigned to it.

<code> console.log(y) </code>

In this case, you will get a message like `not defined` because the variable y is not created, and memory is not allocated for it and we try to reference the variable.

7. What is the use of `typeof` operator?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

The `typeof` is a unary operator which takes a single operand in a statement, it is used to check the data type of its operand in the form of a string for example if we check the variable which is undefined then the `typeof` will return values as `undefined`.

``` java
var x=15;
console.log(typeof (x))
```

It will print the number 15 in the console

<code>
var x = 15;
console.log(typeof (y) == 'number')
</code>

From the above code if the `typeof` y is a number, so from the expression it will print true in the console.

28. What is the use of JavaScript Strict Mode?

 ![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>


- JavaScript is a loosely typed scripting language. 
- JavaScript allows strictness of code by using "use strict"; statement at the top of JavaScript code or in a function.
- For example, when we expect the compiler to give an error if we have used a variable before defining it, then we apply "strict mode" to the JavaScript code.
- The strict mode in JavaScript does not allow us to use undefined variables, reserved keywords as variable or function name, duplicate properties of an object, duplicate parameters of the function, assign values to read-only properties, modifying arguments object, and Deleting an undeletable property.
- Strict mode can be applied to function level in order to implement strictness only in that particular function.
