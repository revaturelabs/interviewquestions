<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Placeholders in JavaScript templates are used to indicate dynamic or variable content that will be inserted into the template. They act as markers where the data will be injected during the rendering process.

5. How do you pass data to a JavaScript template?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Data is usually passed to a JavaScript template by providing an object or JSON as a parameter. The template engine then accesses the data using variable names or expressions defined within the template.

7. What is template inheritance in JavaScript templates?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Template inheritance allows you to create a base or parent template that defines common layout or structure, and then derive child templates that inherit the layout from the parent template. This helps in reusing code and maintaining a consistent structure across multiple templates.

8. How do JavaScript templates prevent XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

JavaScript templates typically have built-in mechanisms or escaping functions to automatically escape any user-generated content that is inserted into the template. This prevents malicious scripts from being executed and protects against XSS attacks.

9. Can JavaScript templates be used for server-side rendering?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Yes, JavaScript templates can be used for server-side rendering (SSR) where the template engine runs on the server to generate HTML markup, which is then sent to the client. This approach is commonly used in frameworks like Express.js or for generating dynamic HTML emails.

</blockquote>

10. Are JavaScript templates limited to generating HTML markup?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

No, JavaScript templates are not limited to generating HTML markup. While they are commonly used for generating HTML templates, they can also be used to generate other text-based formats such as emails, XML, or even plain text.

11. What is the difference between client-side and server-side rendering with JavaScript templates?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Client-side rendering refers to rendering the templates and generating the final output on the client-side (in the browser), typically using JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js. Server-side rendering, on the other hand, involves rendering the templates on the server and sending the pre-rendered HTML to the client. The choice between client-side and server-side rendering depends on factors such as performance, SEO, and the complexity of the application.

12. Can JavaScript templates handle data binding and automatic updates?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Yes, some JavaScript template engines provide data binding capabilities, allowing the template to automatically update when the underlying data changes. This allows for real-time updates of the rendered output based on data changes, making it easier to build reactive and dynamic user interfaces.

13. How do JavaScript templates handle internationalization (i18n)?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

JavaScript templates often provide built-in support for internationalization, allowing you to define translations for different languages and automatically switch between them based on the user's locale. This helps in creating multilingual applications without manually managing language-specific templates.

14. What is template precompilation in JavaScript templates?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Template precompilation involves converting templates into a more efficient form (e.g., JavaScript functions) during a build or compilation process. This can improve the performance of template rendering by eliminating unnecessary parsing or transformation steps at runtime.

15. How do JavaScript templates handle partials or reusable components?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

JavaScript templates often support partials or reusable components, which allow you to define smaller templates that can be included within larger templates. This promotes code reusability and helps in modularizing templates.

16. Can JavaScript templates integrate with data fetching and asynchronous operations?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Yes, JavaScript templates can integrate with data fetching and asynchronous operations. Some template engines provide mechanisms to handle asynchronous data loading, allowing you to fetch data from APIs or perform other async operations and then render the template with the retrieved data.

17. What is template composition in JavaScript templates?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Template composition involves combining multiple templates to create a single, unified view. This allows you to reuse and compose different templates together to build complex UI structures. Template engines often provide features or directives to handle template composition.

18. How do JavaScript templates handle performance optimizations?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

JavaScript templates can employ various performance optimizations, such as template caching, differential updates (only updating parts of the template that have changed), and lazy loading of templates. These optimizations help in improving rendering speed and reducing unnecessary computations.

19. Can JavaScript templates handle form validation and data formatting?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Yes, JavaScript templates can handle form validation and data formatting by integrating with validation libraries or providing built-in functions and directives. This allows you to perform validation checks, format input values, and provide user-friendly error messages within the template.

20. Are JavaScript templates limited to the browser environment?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

No, JavaScript templates can be used in both browser and non-browser environments. While they are commonly associated with client-side rendering in web applications, JavaScript templates can also be used in server-side JavaScript environments (e.g., Node.js) or desktop applications built with frameworks like Electron.
