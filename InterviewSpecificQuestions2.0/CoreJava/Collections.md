2. List the main interfaces, and what are the differences between them?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Set, List and Map are three important interfaces of the Java collection framework.
- A List can be used when the insertion order of elements needs to be maintained.
- We can use a set if we need to maintain a collection that contains no duplicates.
- And Map when data is key-value pairs and need fast retrieval of value based on some key.

3. Why is Map not inherited from the Collection interface, even though it is a component of the Java collection framework? 

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

4. How do you remove an entry from a collection? And subsequently, what is the difference between the `remove()` method of a collection and the `remove()` method of an iterator? Which one will you use while removing elements during iteration?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)


<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Collection interface defines `remove(Object obj)` method to remove objects from `Collection.List` interface and adds another method `remove(int index)`, which is used to remove objects at a specific index.
- You can use any of these methods to remove an entry from Collection, while not iterating. 
- Things change when you iterate. Suppose you are traversing a List and removing only certain elements based on logic, then you need to use Iterator's `remove()` method. 
-This method removes the current element from Iterator's perspective. If you use Collection's or List's `remove()` method during iteration then your code will throw `ConcurrentModificationException`. 
- That's why it's advised to use the iterator `remove()` method to remove objects from Collection.

5. How does HashSet use Hashing?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

HashSet extends `AbstractSet` and implements the Set interface. It creates a collection that uses a hash table for storage. A hash table stores information by using a mechanism called hashing. In hashing, the informational content of a key is used to determine a unique value, called its hash code.

6. How is HashSet implemented in Java?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

When we create an object of HashSet, it internally creates an instance of HashMap with default initial capacity 16. HashSet uses a constructor `HashSet(int capacity)` that represents how many elements can be stored in the HashSet. The capacity may increase automatically when more elements are to be stored

7. Which one do you prefer in Java between Array and ArrayLists for storing objects and why?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Though ArrayList is also backed up by array, it offers some usability advantage over array in Java.Array is fixed length data structure, once created you can not change it's length. On the other hand,ArrayList is dynamic, it automatically allocate a new array and copies content of old array, when it resize.Another reason of using ArrayList over Array is support of Generics.

- No, Collection is a top-level interface of the Java collection framework whereas Collections is a utility class. The below table shows the difference between them.

- Collection:	
    - Collection is a root-level interface of the Java Collection Framework. 
    - Most of the classes in the Java Collection Framework inherit from this interface.	
    - List, Set, and Queue are main sub-interfaces of this interface.	

- Collections:
    - Collections is a utility class in java.util package. 
    - It consists of only static methods which are used to operate on objects of type Collection.
    -  `Collections.max()`, `Collections.min()`, `Collections.sort()` are some methods of Collections class.

The Vector class is preferred over ArrayList class when you are developing a multi-threaded application. 
But, precautions need to be taken because vector may reduce the performance of your application as it is 
Thread-safe and only one thread is allowed to have an object lock at any moment of time and the remaining threads have to wait until a thread releases the object lock. So, it is always recommended that if you don’t need thread safe environment, it is better the to use ArrayList class than the Vector class.And also Vector class is often considered as obsolete or “Due for Deprecation” by many experienced Java developers. They always recommend and advise not to the use Vector class in your code. They prefer using ArrayList over Vector class.

26. How do you pass `List<String>` to a method which accepts `List<Object>`?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

In Java, you cannot directly pass a List<String> to a method that expects a List<Object>. Although String is a subclass of Object, Java generics do not support covariance for non-wildcard type parameters. This means that even though String is a subtype of Object, List<String> is not considered a subtype of List<Object>.

However, you can achieve this by using a wildcard type parameter. Instead of directly passing List<String>, you can declare the method parameter as List<?> or List<? extends Object>. This allows you to pass any type of List, including List<String>, to the method.

Advantages of using `emptySet()` method over creating an object using a constructor are :

1. Immutable: You should prefer to use immutable collections against mutable collections wherever possible. It becomes handy as multiple threads accessing the same instance of an object will see the same values.

2. Concise:  You do not need to manually type out the generic type of the collection - normally it is inferred from the context of the method call.


3. Efficient: As `emptySet()` method doesn’t create new objects, so they just reuse the existing empty and immutable object . Although, practically, this trick is not that handy, and rarely improves the performance

46. What is the difference between HashMap and HashSet in Java?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

**HashSet:-**

- HashSet class implements the Set interface
- In HashSet, we store objects (elements or values) e.g. If we have a HashSet of string elements then it could depict a set of HashSet elements: {“Hello”, “Hi”, “Bye”, “Run”}
- HashSet does not allow duplicate elements that mean you cannot store duplicate values in HashSet.
- HashSet permits to have a single null value.
- HashSet is not synchronized which means they are not suitable for thread-safe operations until unless synchronized explicitly.

**HashMap:-**

- HashMap class implements the Map interface
- HashMap is used for storing key & value pairs. In short, it maintains the mapping of key & value (The  HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it is unsynchronized and permits nulls).  
- This is how you could represent HashMap elements if it has integer key and value of String type: e.g. {1->”Hello”, 2->”Hi”, 3->”Bye”, 4->”Run”}
- HashMap does not allow duplicate keys however it allows having duplicate values.
- HashMap permits single null key and any number of null values.
- HashMap is not synchronized which means they are not suitable for thread-safe operations until unless synchronized explicitly.

51. Differentiate Vector and ArrayList.

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)


<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Vector and ArrayList are both data structures used to store and manage collections of objects in Java, but they have some differences.

*Thread Safety*: Vector is thread-safe, while ArrayList is not. This means that multiple threads can access a Vector object without causing any issues, while accessing an ArrayList from multiple threads at the same time can lead to unexpected behavior.

*Synchronization*: Vector is internally synchronized, which means that each method of Vector acquires a lock on the object before executing, while ArrayList is not synchronized. This can cause some performance overhead with Vector, especially in multi-threaded environments.

*Performance*: Since Vector is synchronized, it has additional overhead that can affect its performance. ArrayList is not synchronized, so it can perform better in scenarios where synchronization is not necessary.

*Capacity*: Both Vector and ArrayList can grow dynamically, but they differ in how they handle capacity. Vector doubles its size when it reaches its capacity, while ArrayList increases its capacity by 50% of its current capacity.

*Iterator*: Vector's iterator is designed to be fail-safe, while ArrayList's iterator is not. This means that if the underlying collection is modified while iterating through a Vector, it will not throw a `ConcurrentModificationException`, while ArrayList's iterator may throw this exception.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Yes, ArrayList and HashMap are different data structures in Java with different characteristics and use cases.

**Internal data structure**:
`ArrayList`: It is internally implemented using an array, which stores a contiguous block of elements.
`HashMap`: It is internally implemented using an array of linked lists, called buckets. Each bucket stores a key-value pair.

**Order of elements**:
`ArrayList`: It maintains the insertion order of elements. The position of an element is determined by the index at which it was inserted.
`HashMap`: It does not maintain the order of elements. The order in which the key-value pairs are stored is not guaranteed.

**Accessing elements**:
`ArrayList`: Elements can be accessed by their index using the get() method. The time complexity for accessing an element is O(1).
`HashMap`: Elements are accessed using their key using the get() method. The time complexity for accessing an element is O(1) on average, but can be O(n) in the worst case when there are many collisions in the bucket.

**Duplicates**:

`ArrayList`: It allows duplicate elements to be stored.
`HashMap`: It allows duplicate values, but not duplicate keys.

**Use cases**:

`ArrayList`: It is useful when you need to store and retrieve elements based on their index, and when the order of elements is important.
`HashMap`: It is useful when you need to store and retrieve key-value pairs, and when the order of elements is not important.

The main difference between HashMap and TreeMap in Java is the way they store and order their elements:

HashMap is implemented using a hash table and is unordered.
TreeMap is implemented using a red-black tree and is ordered based on the natural order of its keys, or based on a custom comparator if provided.

Other differences between HashMap and TreeMap include:

`Performance`: HashMap generally has better performance for most operations due to its constant-time (O(1)) complexity for most operations. TreeMap has a logarithmic-time (O(log n)) complexity for many operations due to its use of a balanced tree.
`Null values`: HashMap allows null keys and values, while TreeMap does not allow null keys but allows null values.
`Memory usage`: HashMap uses less memory than TreeMap for storing the same number of elements.
`Iteration order`: HashMap does not guarantee any specific order for its elements, while TreeMap guarantees a sorted order based on the keys.

<blockquote>

ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe implementation of the Map interface provided by Java's standard library. It allows multiple threads to access and modify the map concurrently without the need for external synchronization.

ConcurrentHashMap achieves thread-safety by dividing the map into several segments, each of which can be locked independently for read and write operations. This allows multiple threads to access different segments of the map simultaneously without blocking each other.

An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, where elements can be accessed using their index, while a linked list is a collection of elements (called nodes) where each node points to the next node using a reference, and elements are accessed sequentially by following the node references. The main difference is that arrays have a fixed size, while linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically.

HashTable is a data structure that maps keys to their associated values using a hash function. It provides constant-time performance for basic operations such as get and put, making it a popular choice for implementing associative arrays, caches, and databases. In a HashTable, keys are hashed to an index in an array, and the associated value is stored at that index. In case of collisions, where two keys hash to the same index, the HashTable uses a collision resolution technique to store and retrieve the values correctly.

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<blockquote>

HashMap works by using a hash function to map keys to an index in an array, where the associated value is stored. When a key-value pair is inserted, the hash function is applied to the key to determine the index in the array where the value should be stored. If another key maps to the same index, a collision occurs. To handle collisions, the HashMap uses a linked list or a balanced tree data structure to store multiple key-value pairs at the same index. When a value is retrieved, the hash function is applied to the key to determine the index in the array, and the list or tree at that index is searched for the key.

Insertion time is generally considered to be fast in a linked list as compared to an array, especially when inserting elements at the beginning or end of the list. This is because a linked list stores its elements in separate nodes that are linked to each other through pointers, so adding or removing elements involves simply updating pointers. However, searching for an element in a linked list can be slower than in an array, as it requires traversing the list sequentially until the element is found.

A Map is an interface in Java that stores key-value pairs. It works by associating keys with values and allowing the retrieval of values based on their corresponding keys. When an entry is added to a map, it is stored as a key-value pair, and the key is used to retrieve the corresponding value. In order to retrieve a value from a map, you provide the key associated with that value, and the map returns the value that was associated with that key. Maps can have duplicate values but not duplicate keys, and they can be implemented using various data structures such as hash tables, trees, or linked lists.

The time complexity of Map and List operations depends on the specific implementation of the Map or List data structure.

However, some operations like iterating over a Map can have a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of entries in the Map.

List operations have a time complexity of O(1) for accessing elements by index using an ArrayList, but O(n) for inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the list as all subsequent elements need to be shifted. LinkedList, on the other hand, has O(1) time complexity for insertion or deletion at any position, but O(n) time complexity for accessing elements by index.

To display only the duplicates in an array of numbers, we can use a combination of loops and conditional statements to compare each element in the array to every other element in the array, and print out the duplicate elements. Here's an example code snippet in Java:

```Java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3};
for(int i=0; i<numbers.length; i++) {
   for(int j=i+1; j<numbers.length; j++) {
      if(numbers[i] == numbers[j]) {
         System.out.println(numbers[i]);
         break;
      }
   }
}
```

86. What is an ArrayMap ?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

In Java, an array map is a data structure that maps keys to values, similar to a regular Map, but with an underlying array-based implementation. An array map is useful when the number of keys is relatively small and known in advance, and when you need fast access to the values associated with each key.

Here's an example of how to create and use an array map in Java:

```Java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ArrayMap<K, V> {
    private Object[] keys;
    private Object[] values;
    private int size;

    public ArrayMap(int capacity) {
        this.keys = new Object[capacity];
        this.values = new Object[capacity];
        this.size = 0;
    }

    public void put(K key, V value) {
        int index = Arrays.binarySearch(keys, 0, size, key);
        if (index < 0) {
            index = -(index + 1);
            if (size >= keys.length) {
                keys = Arrays.copyOf(keys, size * 2);
                values = Arrays.copyOf(values, size * 2);
            }
            System.arraycopy(keys, index, keys, index + 1, size - index);
            System.arraycopy(values, index, values, index + 1, size - index);
            keys[index] = key;
            size++;
        }
        values[index] = value;
    }

    public V get(K key) {
        int index = Arrays.binarySearch(keys, 0, size, key);
        if (index >= 0) {
            return (V) values[index];
        }
        return null;
    }
}

```

87. Give an example of when to use a generic function in Java?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

A generic function in Java can be useful in situations where the same logic needs to be applied to different types of data. For example, a sorting function that can sort an array of integers or an array of strings would benefit from being generic. Instead of having separate sorting functions for each data type, a single generic function can be used for both cases, improving code reusability and reducing code duplication.

88. How do you add and remove an element in an ArrayList?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></b></summary>
<blockquote>


In Java, you can add and remove elements from an `ArrayList` using the `add()` and `remove()` methods, respectively. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("apple");
        list.add("banana");
        list.add("cherry");
        System.out.println(list); // [apple, banana, cherry]
        list.add(1, "orange");
        System.out.println(list); // [apple, orange, banana, cherry]
        list.remove("banana");
        System.out.println(list); // [apple, orange, cherry]
        list.remove(0);
        System.out.println(list); // [orange, cherry]
    }
}
```

This creates an `ArrayList` called `list` and adds three string values to it. It then adds the string `"orange"` at index 1 using the `add()` method with two arguments. After that, it removes the string `"banana"` from the list using the `remove()` method with one argument, and then removes the element at index 0 using the `remove()` method with one argument. The output of this example will be:

```
[apple, banana, cherry]
[apple, orange, banana, cherry]
[apple, orange, cherry]
[orange, cherry]
```

89. What are the properties of an ArrayList?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></b></summary>
<blockquote>

- An `ArrayList` is a dynamic array that can change size at runtime.
- An `ArrayList` can store objects of any type.
- Elements in an `ArrayList` are ordered and can be accessed using an index.
- An `ArrayList` can contain duplicate elements.
- An `ArrayList` can be sorted using the `sort()` method from the `Collections` class.
- An `ArrayList` is not synchronized, meaning that multiple threads can access it simultaneously.

90. Arrays vs ArrayList.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

Array is a fixes size data structure while size of arraylist is dynamic. We have to specify the size of array at the time of creation while there is no need of specifying size of an arraylist. array can store primitive data types, while an ArrayList can only store objects. Arrays are faster as compared to arraylist.

91. What is the importance of hashCode() and equals() methods in HashMap?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

HashMap uses the Key object hashCode() and equals() method to determine the index to put the key-value pair. These methods are also used when we try to get value from HashMap. If these methods are not implemented correctly, two different Key's might produce the same hashCode() and equals() output and in that case, rather than storing it at a different location, HashMap will consider the same and overwrite them. Similarly all the collection classes that doesn't store duplicate data use hashCode() and equals() to find duplicates, so it's very important to implement them correctly. The implementation of equals() and hashCode() should follow these rules.
-   If `o1.equals(o2)`, then `o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode()`should always be `true`.
-   If `o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode` is true, it doesn't mean that `o1.equals(o2)` will be `true`.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

PriorityQueue is an unbounded queue based on a priority heap and the elements are ordered in their natural order or we can provide [Comparator] for ordering at the time of creation. PriorityQueue doesn't allow null values and we can't add any object that doesn't provide natural ordering or we don't have any comparator for them for ordering. Java PriorityQueue is not [thread-safe] and provided O(log(n)) time for enqueing and dequeing operations.

95. What is BlockingQueue?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

`java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue` is a Queue that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving and removing an element, and wait for space to become available in the queue when adding an element. BlockingQueue interface is part of the java collections framework and it’s primarily used for implementing the producer-consumer problem. We don’t need to worry about waiting for the space to be available for producer or object to be available for consumers in BlockingQueue as it’s handled by implementation classes of BlockingQueue. Java provides several BlockingQueue implementations such as ArrayBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue, PriorityBlockingQueue, SynchronousQueue, etc.

`java.util.EnumSet` is Set implementation to use with enum types. All of the elements in an enum set must come from a single enum type that is specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the set is created. EnumSet is not synchronized and null elements are not allowed. It also provides some useful methods like copyOf(Collection c), of(E first, E… rest) and complementOf(EnumSet s).
