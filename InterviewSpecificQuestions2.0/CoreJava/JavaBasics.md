Access modifiers allow us to set the scope or accessibility, or visibility of a data member be it a field, constructor, class, or method.  The four different types of access specifiers
- Public
- Protected
- Private
- Default

Private is more protective. When the methods or data members declared as private, then we can access them only within the class in which they are declared.

When we create a variable within a method, it cannot be accessed outside that method. The scope of that variable is a local scope.

**Example:** Here `age` is a variable declared inside the `printAge()` method. It can be accessed only inside the `printAge()`. So, we can say `age` variable has a local scope

```java
public class Test {

	public void printAge() {
		int age = 7;

- There is no need to create an object for the class to access the static variable or static method. 
- We can use the class name to call them with respect to the access modifier.
- If we use the object name to call the static method or variable, the compiler will replace the name of the object with class.

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

final keyword is a non-access specifier that can be used with class, variable, and method to restrict changes or make it as constant. 

- If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value.
- If we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses. 
- And, if we declare a class as final, we restrict the other classes to inherit or extend it.

```

Final Variable  ---> To create constant variable
Final Method    ---> Prevents Method Overriding
Final Class     ---> Prevents Inheritance

<blockquote>
 
 `public static void main(String[] args)` -  main method is the e**ntry point of any java program**

- `public` is an access specifier of the main method. It must be `public` so that java runtime can execute this method. 
- `static` is non-access modifier. When java runtime starts, there is no object of the class present. That’s why the main method must be static so that JVM can load the class into memory and call the main method.
- `void`is a return type, means main method not going to return anything. 
- `main` is a method name  
- `String[] args` - Java main method accepts a single argument of type String array. This is also called as java command line arguments.

24.  How is garbage collection done in Java? Does it stop our program from running?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

- The most common garbage collector in Java is the concurrent mark and sweep collector, which runs on a background daemon thread and does not stop the application's threads from running. This collector identifies unused objects and frees their memory as needed, without causing significant interruptions to the application's performance.

- The secont one is stop-the-world collector, it is triggered when the JVM detects that the application is running low on available memory. When this occurs, the collector will pause the application's threads and perform a full garbage collection cycle to reclaim as much memory as possible. This pause can potentially cause a noticeable interruption in the application's performance, particularly if the heap is large and the garbage collection process takes a significant amount of time to complete.

27. List and explain some of the array methods in Java.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

There are several array methods in Java that can be used to manipulate arrays. Some commonly used array methods:

1. **`length`:** This method returns the length of an array, i.e., the number of elements in the array.

2. **`clone`:** This method creates a new array with the same elements as the original array.

3. **`copyOf`:** This method creates a new array with the specified length, and copies elements from the original array into the new array. If the original array is shorter than the specified length, the new array is padded with default values.

4. **`fill`:** This method fills the elements of an array with a specified value.

5. **`sort`:** This method sorts the elements of an array in ascending order.

6. **`binarySearch`:** This method searches an array for a specified value using the binary search algorithm.

7. `equals`: This method compares two arrays for equality. Two arrays are considered equal if they have the same length and contain the same elements in the same order.

An example that uses some of these array methods:

```java
int[] arr1 = {2, 5, 1, 9, 7};
int[] arr2 = arr1.clone(); // creates a new array with the same elements
int[] arr3 = Arrays.copyOf(arr1, 7); // creates a new array with length 7, padded with default values
Arrays.fill(arr1, 0); // fills all elements of arr1 with the value 0
Arrays.sort(arr2); // sorts the elements of arr2 in ascending order
int index = Arrays.binarySearch(arr2, 5); // searches for the value 5 in arr2 using binary search
boolean equal = Arrays.equals(arr1, arr3); // compares arr1 and arr3 for equality

The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value may be modified by multiple threads at the same time. Without the `volatile` keyword, different threads may create their own copy of that variable which will contain a different value for a different thread. This can lead to incorrect results. The `volatile` keyword helps to prevent this by forcing threads to always read the variable's value from main memory, rather than from a cached copy.

In Java, a static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than to an instance of the class. This means that you can call a static method on the class itself, without needing to create an instance of the class first. A static method can access only other static members of the class and can't access non-static members.

54. How is a "yield" different from a "return"?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary> 

<blockquote> 

In Java, "yield" and "return" are two different keywords with distinct meanings.

1. `return` is used to exit a method and return a value to the caller. for example:

```java
public int add(int a, int b) {
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum; // using "return" to exit the method and return the value of sum to the caller
}
```
In the example above, the "add" method takes two integer arguments and returns their sum using the "return" keyword.

2. `yield` is used in switch expressions to provide a value based on a specific condition. for example:

```java
public String getDayOfWeek(int day) {
    return switch (day) {
        case 1 -> "Monday";
        case 2 -> "Tuesday";
        case 3 -> "Wednesday";
        case 4 -> "Thursday";
        case 5 -> "Friday";
        case 6 -> "Saturday";
        case 7 -> "Sunday";
        default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid day of the week: " + day);
    };
}
```

In the above example  the "case" keyword is used to define a specific case or condition, and the "-> yield" expression is used to provide the value to be returned for that case.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary> 

<blockquote> 

In Java, float and double are both used to represent floating-point numbers, which are numbers that have a fractional part. The main difference between float and double is their precision and the amount of memory they require to store values.

- float: represents a 32-bit floating-point value, with a range of approximately ±3.4 x 10^38 and a precision of about 6-7 decimal digits.
- double: represents a 64-bit floating-point value, with a range of approximately ±1.7 x 10^308 and a precision of about 15-16 decimal digits.

Double is generally used when more precision is needed, such as in scientific calculations or financial applications. Float is used when memory is a concern and the extra precision is not necessary. In practice, double is the more commonly used floating-point data type in Java.

<blockquote>

The access modifiers are used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members such as variables, methods, and inner classes.

When a class, method, or variable is declared as `public`, it can be accessed from any other part of the program. For example, if a method is declared as `public`, it can be called from any other class in the program. When a class, method, or variable is declared as `private`, it can only be accessed within the same class. This is useful when we want to restrict access to certain classes or methods to only the class in which they are declared.

<blockquote>

In Java, the `final` keyword is used to declare that a variable, method, or class cannot be changed or overridden. Here are some scenarios where the `final` keyword would be useful:

1. Constants: If you want to define a value that should not be changed during runtime, you can declare it as a `final` variable. For example:

   ```java
   final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
   ```

2. Security: If you want to prevent a method from being overridden in a subclass, you can declare it as `final`. This can be useful for security-related methods, such as password verification or encryption.

3. Efficiency: Declaring a variable or parameter as `final` can help the compiler optimize your code, because it knows that the value cannot change and can make certain assumptions.


Overall, the `final` keyword is a useful tool for creating constants, improving security, optimizing code, and improving clarity.

<blockquote>

There are several levels of garbage collection in Java, including:

- Young generation: This is where new objects are created, and the garbage collector runs frequently to remove short-lived objects that are no longer referenced.
- Old generation: This is where long-lived objects are stored, and the garbage collector runs less frequently to remove objects that are no longer referenced.
- Permanent generation: This is where metadata for the Java classes is stored, and the garbage collector runs even less frequently than in the old generation.
- Metaspace: This is where metadata for the Java classes is stored, and it is a replacement for the Permanent generation starting from Java 8.

The exact configuration and behavior of garbage collection in Java depend on the JVM implementation and the runtime options that are used.

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

In Java, when a new object is created, it is initially allocated in the young generation. The young generation is divided into two spaces: an `eden` space and a `survivor` space. When the `eden` space becomes full, a minor garbage collection is triggered, and any objects that are still referenced are moved to the `survivor` space. If an object survives multiple minor garbage collections, it is promoted to the old generation.

Objects in the old generation are subject to major garbage collections, which run less frequently than minor garbage collections. The goal of a major garbage collection is to free up space in the old generation by identifying and removing objects that are no longer referenced. If an object survives a major garbage collection, it remains in the old generation until it is no longer referenced or until the program terminates.

<blockquote>

Garbage collection is used in Java to perform automatic memory management. It deletes the objects in memory that are no longer being used by the program, and freeup the space in memory. When an object is created, Java keeps track of its reference count. When an object is no longer referenced by the program, its reference count is reduced to zero, and it becomes eligible for garbage collection. The garbage collector periodically scan the heap for objects that have a reference count of zero and delete them. It helps prevent memory leaks and makes programming in Java more convenient and safe.

In Java, you can create a list of pairs of indexes that sum to a target value using a hash map. Here's an example:

```java
int[] arr = { 2, 7, 11, 15 };
int target = 9;
Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    int complement = target - arr[i];
    if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
        List<Integer> pair = Arrays.asList(map.get(complement), i);
        result.add(pair);
    }
    map.put(arr[i], i);
}
System.out.println(result);
```

This creates an array called `arr` with four integer values, and a target value of 9. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through the array, checking if there is a complement value in a hash map. If there is a complement value, it creates a pair of indexes and adds them to a list called `result`. Finally, it prints the `result` list to the console. The output of this example will be `[[0, 1]]`, which indicates that the pairs of indexes that sum to 9 are (0,1) in the input array `arr`.

<blockquote>

To return the peak value index from an integer array mountain, you can use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to point to the first and last elements of the array, respectively.
2. While `left < right`:
   - Calculate the middle index, `mid`, as `(left + right) / 2`.
   - If `array[mid] < array[mid+1]`, set `left` to `mid+1`.
   - Otherwise, set `right` to `mid`.
3. Return `left` as the peak value index.

This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the array in half and checking whether the middle element is part of an increasing or decreasing sequence. The peak value index is where the increasing sequence ends and the decreasing sequence begins.

To write a regex pattern for a phone number in Java, you can use the following pattern:

```Java
String regex = "^\\+(?:[0-9] ?){6,14}[0-9]$";
```

This pattern matches phone numbers in the format of a plus sign, followed by six to fourteen digits, with optional spaces between the digits.

Here's an explanation of the different parts of the pattern:

`^` - Matches the start of the string
`\\+` - Matches a literal plus sign
`(?:[0-9] ?)` - Matches a single digit with an optional space character
`{6,14}` - Specifies the minimum and maximum number of times the previous match can occur, in this case, between 6 and 14 times.
`[0-9]` - Matches a single digit
`$` - Matches the end of the string.

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Java Messaging Service (JMS) is a Java-based messaging standard that allows distributed applications to communicate with each other. It is a message-oriented middleware API that allows Java applications to send and receive messages asynchronously.

JMS provides a common way for applications to create, send, receive, and read messages. It defines a set of standard interfaces and protocols that enable seamless communication between different messaging systems, such as IBM MQ, Apache ActiveMQ, and RabbitMQ.

83. How does JNDI work?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

JNDI stands for Java Naming and Directory Interface, and it is a standard interface to access naming and directory services in Java. It provides a common interface for accessing naming and directory services, regardless of the underlying technology used by the service.

In JNDI, you can bind objects to names in a hierarchical namespace, which can be accessed by clients using a standard API. This allows you to separate the location of objects from the code that uses them, making it easier to manage and maintain distributed systems.

84. How do you differentiate groovy from java using syntax?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

<blockquote>

Groovy and Java have similar syntax, but there are a few key differences:

`Semicolons`: In Java, semicolons are required at the end of each statement, but in Groovy, they are optional.

`Type Declaration`: Java is a statically typed language, which means that you must declare the data type of a variable before you use it. Groovy, on the other hand, is a dynamically typed language, so you do not need to declare the data type of a variable.

`String Concatenation`: In Java, you can concatenate strings using the "+" operator, while in Groovy, you can use either "+" or the string interpolation syntax, which uses "${}".

`Method Definition`: In Java, you define a method using the "public static void" syntax, while in Groovy, you can omit the "public" and "void" keywords.

`Collection Literal`: In Java, you define a collection using the "new" keyword and the type of the collection. In Groovy, you can use shorthand syntax to define a collection literal, such as "[1, 2, 3]" for a list of integers.

<blockquote>

```Java 

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // create a new HashMap object
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        // add key-value pairs to the map
        map.put("apple", 1);
        map.put("banana", 2);
        map.put("orange", 3);

        // get the value for a specific key
        int value = map.get("banana");

        // check if the map contains a specific key
        boolean containsKey = map.containsKey("orange");

        // remove a key-value pair from the map
        map.remove("apple");

        // loop over the key-value pairs in the map
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println("Key: " + entry.getKey() + ", Value: " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}

```

In this example, we create a new HashMap object and add key-value pairs to it using the put() method. We can retrieve the value for a specific key using the get() method and check if the map contains a specific key using the containsKey() method. We can remove a key-value pair from the map using the remove() method. Finally, we loop over the key-value pairs in the map using a for-each loop and the entrySet() method.

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        result[i] = n * (i + 1);
    }
    return result;
}
}
```

This function first creates an integer array of length m to store the results. It then uses a loop to iterate m times, multiplying n by the current iteration number (i + 1) and storing the result in the corresponding index of the array. Finally, the function returns the array of results.

        bubbleSort(arr);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
    }
    
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    // swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```
**Output**
`[1,2,5,5,6,9]`

In this example, we have an array of integers arr. We call the bubbleSort function passing in this array as an argument. The function sorts the array using bubble sort, and then we print the sorted array using the Arrays.toString method.

The bubbleSort function uses two nested loops to compare adjacent elements in the array and swap them if they are in the wrong order. The outer loop iterates over the array from the first element to the second-to-last element, while the inner loop iterates over the unsorted part of the array. If the element at index j is greater than the element at index j+1, the two elements are swapped. After the inner loop completes, the largest element in the unsorted part of the array is placed at the end. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

89. Can you write a Java code for Singleton design pattern ?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>

<blockquote>

```Java

public class Singleton {
    // Private static variable to hold the single instance of the class
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    // Private constructor to prevent creation of new instances
    private Singleton() {}
    
    // Public static method to get the single instance of the class
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        // If instance is null, create a new instance
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        // Return the instance
        return instance;
    }
    
    // Other methods and variables of the class
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something...");
    }
}

```

In this example, we have a class Singleton with a private constructor and a private static variable instance that holds the single instance of the class. We also have a public static method getInstance() that returns the single instance of the class. The getInstance() method checks if the instance variable is null, and if so, creates a new instance of the class. Otherwise, it simply returns the existing instance.

            current = next;
        }
        head = prev;
    }
 
    public void printList() {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main list = new Main();
        list.head = new Node(1);
        list.head.next = new Node(2);
        list.head.next.next = new Node(3);
        list.head.next.next.next = new Node(4);
        System.out.println("Original Linked list");
        list.printList();
        list.reverse();
        System.out.println("");
        System.out.println("Reversed linked list ");
        list.printList();
    }
}

```

This code defines a LinkedList class with a Node inner class. The reverse() method reverses the linked list by iterating through each node and changing its next pointer to point to the previous node. Finally, the head of the linked list is set to the last node, which becomes the new head of the reversed linked list. The printList() method simply prints the values in the linked list. The main() method creates a linked list with four nodes and prints the original and reversed linked lists.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>

<blockquote>

In Java, strings are stored in the heap memory. This is because a String object is created dynamically using the new keyword or through string literals, which results in the allocation of memory on the heap. However, string literals that are created at compile-time are stored in a separate area called the String constant pool, which is part of the heap memory.

93. What are the different types of loops in Java? Provide examples.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>

<blockquote>

The different types of loops in Java are:

1. **for loop**: It is used to iterate a block of code a specific number of times.
   Example:
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
   }
   ```

2. **while loop**: It repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.
   Example:
   ```java
   int i = 0;
   while (i < 5) {
       System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
       i++;
   }
   ```

3. **do-while loop**: It is similar to a while loop but guarantees that the code block is executed at least once, even if the condition is false initially.
   Example:
   ```java
   int i = 0;
   do {
       System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
       i++;
   } while (i < 5);
   ```

These loops provide different ways to control the flow of execution in Java programs.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>

<blockquote>

The main difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is the condition check.

- In a while loop, the condition is checked before the execution of the loop. If the condition is false initially, the loop body will not be executed at all.
- In a do-while loop, the loop body is executed first, and then the condition is checked. This guarantees that the loop body will be executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

In summary, a while loop may not execute the loop body if the condition is false initially, while a do-while loop will always execute the loop body at least once.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>

<blockquote>

The `super` keyword in Java is used to refer to the superclass or parent class. It is primarily used to access or invoke the superclass's members (methods, variables, constructors) from a subclass. Here's an example to illustrate its usage:

```java
class Vehicle {
    protected String brand;

    public Vehicle(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand);
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    private String model;

    public Car(String brand, String model) {
        super(brand); // invoking the superclass constructor
        this.model = model;
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        super.displayInfo(); // invoking the superclass method
        System.out.println("Model: " + model);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car("Toyota", "Camry");
        car.displayInfo();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Vehicle` class is the superclass, and the `Car` class is a subclass that extends `Vehicle`. By using the `super` keyword, we can call the superclass constructor `Vehicle(String brand)` from the `Car` constructor to initialize the `brand` member. Additionally, we use `super.displayInfo()` to invoke the `displayInfo()` method of the superclass before displaying the additional information specific to the `Car` class.

Output:
```
Brand: Toyota
Model: Camry
```

By utilizing the `super` keyword, we can access and utilize the members and behavior of the superclass within the subclass.
