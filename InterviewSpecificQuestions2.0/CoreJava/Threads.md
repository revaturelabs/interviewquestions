15. How would you make three threads execute at the same time?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

In Java, you can make three threads execute at the same time by using the Thread class and its associated methods. Here's a sample code that creates three threads and runs them concurrently:

```Java
public class ThreeThreadsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create three threads
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable(), "Thread 1");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable(), "Thread 2");
        Thread thread3 = new Thread(new MyRunnable(), "Thread 3");

        // Start all three threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread3.start();

        // Wait for all three threads to complete
        try {
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
            thread3.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Main thread interrupted");
        }

        System.out.println("All threads have finished executing");
    }

    private static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is starting");

17. List the pros/cons of multithreading?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

**Pros**:

`Improved performance`: Multithreading can improve the performance of an application by allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously and thus utilizing available resources more efficiently.
`Responsiveness`: Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of an application by allowing the UI thread to remain responsive while other threads perform long-running tasks.
`Resource sharing`: Multithreading enables multiple threads to share the same resources, such as memory and I/O devices, which can result in better resource utilization and reduced overhead.

**Cons**:

`Complexity`: Multithreading can make an application more complex and difficult to debug due to the increased complexity of managing multiple threads.
`Synchronization`: Multithreading requires careful management of shared resources to avoid synchronization issues, such as race conditions and deadlocks.
`Overhead`: Multithreading can introduce overhead due to the additional management required to create, manage, and synchronize threads, which can result in reduced performance if not implemented properly.

18. Do you know how to initialize a thread in Java?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

Yes, in Java, there are two ways to initialize a thread:

1. `Extending the Thread class`: You can create a new class that extends the Thread class and override the run() method to define the thread's behavior. Then you can create an instance of the new class and call its start() method to start the thread.

```Java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Define thread behavior here
    }
}
// Create and start the thread
MyThread thread = new MyThread();
thread.start();
```

2. `Implementing the Runnable interface`: You can create a new class that implements the Runnable interface and override the run() method to define the thread's behavior. Then you can create an instance of the new class and pass it to the Thread constructor to create a new thread object. Finally, you can call the start() method on the thread object to start the thread.

```java

class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // Define thread behavior here
    }
}

// Create and start the thread
MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
thread.start();
```

Both methods are valid ways to create and initialize a thread in Java, and which one you choose depends on your specific needs and preferences.

19. What is the purpose of synchronized keyword in Java?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

In Java, the synchronized keyword is used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads. When a method or block of code is declared as synchronized, only one thread can access the code at a time, while other threads are blocked until the first thread has completed its execution.

```Java

public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized void decrement() {
        count--;

20. What is a Synchronized list in Java?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

In Java, the java.util.Collections class provides a convenient way to synchronize access to a list by wrapping it in a synchronized collection. This is done by calling the Collections.synchronizedList() method, which returns a synchronized (thread-safe) list backed by the specified list.

Here's an example code snippet:

```Java

List<String> myList = new ArrayList<String>();
List<String> synchronizedList = Collections.synchronizedList(myList);

// Accessing synchronized list from multiple threads
synchronized (synchronizedList) {
    // Access or modify the synchronized list here

21. How do you implement runnable in java? 

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

To implement Runnable in Java, you need to follow these steps:

- Create a class that implements the Runnable interface.
- Override the run() method in the Runnable interface with the code you want to execute in the thread.
- Create an instance of the class you just created.
- Create a Thread object, passing in the instance of the class you created as a constructor argument.
- Call the start() method on the Thread object to start the thread.

Here's an example code snippet:

```Java
public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Code to execute in the thread
    }
}

// Create an instance of the class that implements Runnable
MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();

// Create a Thread object and pass in the instance of the class that implements Runnable
Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);

// Start the thread
thread.start();

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

To make a singleton thread-safe in Java, you can use the double-checked locking pattern, which ensures that only one instance of the singleton is created, even in a multithreaded environment.

Here's an example code snippet:

```Java
public class MySingleton {
    private static volatile MySingleton instance;

    private MySingleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation

    public static MySingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (MySingleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new MySingleton();
                }

35. How does the ExecutorService framework work in Java threads?

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

The `ExecutorService` framework in Java provides a higher-level interface for managing and executing threads. It abstracts the complexity of thread creation, management, and pooling.

With `ExecutorService`, you create an instance of an executor, such as `ThreadPoolExecutor` or `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`. You can submit tasks to the executor using the `submit()` method, which returns a `Future` representing the result of the task.

The executor manages a pool of worker threads and assigns tasks to them. It automatically handles thread creation, reuse, and termination based on the specified configuration. This eliminates the need to manually create and manage threads.

Additionally, `ExecutorService` provides methods to control the execution flow, such as shutting down the executor gracefully and waiting for all submitted tasks to complete.

Overall, the `ExecutorService` framework simplifies the management of threads and provides efficient thread pooling and task execution capabilities.
