- An expression is madeup of variable, constants and operators.

    ```
- The above statement will return boolean value based wheather they equal or not.

    `x + y*8 + 5/Z`
- In this expression, we have to seperate them by using brackets else it will executes in bodmos rule.

- A block starts with braces open and end with braces close.
- All the open braces should be balanced by close braces.

	public static void main(String[] args) {// opening method
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}// closing method
}// closing class
```
